They also don't charge extra transaction fees. Awesome customer support. Highly recommended!!\n\nJared\n\nNew Zealand\n\nFreshLearn is amazing !\n\nVery friendly platform. The team was so helpful and quick. FreshLearn was so serious about leveraging the capability of online education. I am very impressed with the platform.\n\nLisa M\n\nBusiness Owner\n\nWebsite Migration made easy.\n\nThe Freshlearn team has been a huge help with our website and course migration. The migration team was able to work within out timeline to transition everything over and ensure that the website was exactly like we wanted.\n\nRobert Gannon\n\nTaiwan\n\nTop level experts, fast and thorough!\n\nTeam is always friendly and professional. They are very eager to assist me and I am not tech savvy. I will continue to recommend FreshLearn to those who have interest without reservation. Having fast tech support is a great benefit that I didn't have with my last platform provider.\n\nJesse R. Brown ND\n\nUnited States\n\nWow!\n\nWow. Real people really helping me instead of robots!

They also don't charge extra transaction fees. Awesome customer support. Highly recommended!!\n\nJared\n\nNew Zealand\n\nFreshLearn is amazing !\n\nVery friendly platform. The team was so helpful and quick. FreshLearn was so serious about leveraging the capability of online education. I am very impressed with the platform.\n\nLisa M\n\nBusiness Owner\n\nWebsite Migration made easy.\n\nThe Freshlearn team has been a huge help with our website and course migration. The migration team was able to work within out timeline to transition everything over and ensure that the website was exactly like we wanted.\n\nRobert Gannon\n\nTaiwan\n\nTop level experts, fast and thorough!\n\nTeam is always friendly and professional. They are very eager to assist me and I am not tech savvy. I will continue to recommend FreshLearn to those who have interest without reservation. Having fast tech support is a great benefit that I didn't have with my last platform provider.\n\nJesse R. Brown ND\n\nUnited States\n\nWow!\n\nWow. Real people really helping me instead of robots! Really friendly and super capable people too! Questions answered in seconds. A platform that delivers everything I was looking for. Definitely a five-star experience. I LOVE Freshlearn and its people!\n\nEwald Theunisse\n\nNetherlands\n\nSuper learning platform\n\nFreshLearn team gave me a lot of support setting up my site.

The team is patient, and no question is disregarded.\n\nSandra R.\n\nUnited States\n\nAmazing membership course software\n\nThe support is the best I've ever experienced for a software company.

After three weeks from signing up for Freshlearn, we are ready to launch!\n\nAdeah W.\n\nSmall Business Owner\n\nGood Support\n\nGot on the call with support about an API feature I needed. The call was straight forward, they said they will get in touch with the team and will be very honest with me for the timeline of such a feature request, even if that timeline would be very long or if they wouldn't implement the feature.\n\nBrian Akhtar\n\nUnited States\n\nGreat product and support.\n\nI really like using freshlearn and the effort they put in to get it as I want. Before, I used a way more expensive option, which was actually too much overkill for what I needed.I recommend this to everyone who looks for a great platform at an affordable cost\n\nStijin\n\nBelgium\n\nGet advanced features, 24x7 live support for an affordable and creator friendly price.
