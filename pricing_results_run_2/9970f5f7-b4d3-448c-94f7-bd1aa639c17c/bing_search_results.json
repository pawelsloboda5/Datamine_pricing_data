What factors affect CRM software cost?\n    \n    CRM pricing refers to the cost of implementing and using [customer relationship management software](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/products/what-is-crm).

On average, the typical cost of CRM software ranges from less than a hundred to several hundred dollars per user per year, with some enterprise-level solutions costing even more. To find the best CRM software prices, research and compare CRM providers based on their pricing plans and features. Pipedrive offers different solutions at price points to match users\u2019 requirements.
