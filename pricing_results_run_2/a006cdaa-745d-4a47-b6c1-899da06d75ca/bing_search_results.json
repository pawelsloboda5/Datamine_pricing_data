At first, I was very worried about the transition and learning the software, but AgencyBloc's staff is helpful, patient, and nice. Now, I wonder how I ever lived (and did my job as the one who pays the agents) without it. It makes my job a breeze! I would recommend AB to everyone.\"\n\n![Image 11](https://resources.agencybloc.com/hubfs/Testimonials/Client%20Headshots/Testimonials%20Page/tiffany-sollars-75.jpg)\n\n**Tiffany S.**  \nHealth Insurance Associates\n\n\"Since we began AgencyBloc over three years ago, we have been able to triple our book of business. The Commission Module alone has saved me thousands of dollars in payroll while decreasing human error. I'm confident that when I pay my agents, I pay them exactly what I promised. I highly recommend AgencyBloc for anyone looking to take their business to the next level.\"\n\n![Image 12](https://resources.agencybloc.com/hubfs/Testimonials/Client%20Headshots/Testimonials%20Page/brain-spire-75.jpg)\n\n**Brian S.**  \nSouth Dakota Senior Insurance\n\nReady to see the **#1 Recommended Insurance Industry Growth Platform** in action?\n\n[See How It Works](https://www.agencybloc.com/watch-overview-video/) [Schedule Demo](https://www.agencybloc.com/schedule-demo/)\n\n[Platform](https://www.agencybloc.com/software-solutions/)\n\n*   [Sales Enablement](https://www.agencybloc.com/ams/sales-enablement/)\n*   [Quoting & Proposals](https://www.agencybloc.com/quoting/)\n*   [Customers & Policies](https://www.agencybloc.com/ams/customer-and-policy-management/)\n*   [Commissions](https://www.agencybloc.com/commissions-management/)\n*   [Data & Security](https://www.agencybloc.com/ams/data-and-security/)\n*   [Pricing](https://www.agencybloc.com/pricing/)\n*   [Start a Free Trial](https://www.agencybloc.com/free-trial/)\n\n[Company](https://www.agencybloc.com/about-us/)\n\n*   [Our Story](https://www.agencybloc.com/about-us/our-story/)\n*   [Senior Leadership](https://www.agencybloc.com/about-us/our-leadership-team/)\n*   [Testimonials](https://www.agencybloc.com/about-us/testimonials/)\n*   [Case Studies](https://www.agencybloc.com/resources/type/case-study/)\n*   [News](https://www.agencybloc.com/news/)\n*   [Careers](https://www.agencybloc.com/about-us/careers/)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.agencybloc.com/about-us/contact-us/)\n\n[Industry Insights](https://www.agencybloc.com/resources/)\n\n*   [Business Growth](https://www.agencybloc.com/resources/tags/business%20growth/)\n*   [Agency Optimization](https://www.agencybloc.com/resources/tags/agency%20optimization/)\n*   [Customer Service](https://www.agencybloc.com/resources/tags/customer%20service/)\n*   [Free Downloads](https://www.agencybloc.com/resources/tags/download/)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get the latest news, updates, and industry insights delivered straight to your inbox.\n\n![Image 13](https://www.agencybloc.com/images/logo-block-gradient.svg)\n\n*   [Facebook (opens in a new window)](https://www.facebook.com/agencybloc)\n*   [Twitter (opens in a new window)](https://x.com/agencybloc)\n*   [LinkedIn (opens in a new window)](http://www.linkedin.com/company/agencybloc)\n*   [Instagram (opens in a new window)](https://www.instagram.com/agencyblocams/)\n*   [YouTube (opens in a new window)](https://www.youtube.com/c/agencybloc)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 AgencyBloc.
