Wicked Reports shows lifetime revenue attribution, from the very first click to the very last click, and all the touch points in between.\n    \n*   [#### I've tried other platforms and they aren't accurate](https://www.wickedreports.com/pricing#)\n    \n    Wicked Reports transparently shows attribution percentage and ALL clicks, leads, and sales tracked.\n    \n    This is the importance of using first-party attribution data, rather than relying on what a platform (like Facebook) is saying. Those numbers are often inflated and take credit for sales they didn't see, plus, the look back window is TOO SHORT. Also, they can't give you an accurate overall picture of your marketing.\n    \n*   [#### Sometimes I need help but please don't make me watch a ton of videos or get on another Zoom](https://www.wickedreports.com/pricing#)\n    \n    You're in luck!  \n      \n    Our Live Chat feature is a super quick way to request help - and a live person will answer you!  \n      \n    If you are going to handle the onboarding yourself and do not require assistance from our support team, we can waive the onboarding fee for you and allow you to start paying your monthly subscription charges immediately.  \n      \n    Please talk to your sales rep for additional details.\n    \n*   [#### I don't want to spend any more money on another marketing attribution tool](https://www.wickedreports.com/pricing#)\n    \n    Ecommerce marketers realize that in order to get a clear picture of **what every marketing dollar is doing, an external tool that provides first party data is not an added expense. It is a necessary secret weapon in scaling ROAS and seeing huge ROI.**\n    \n    Wicked Reports actually identifies wasted ad spend GREATER than the cost of Wicked.\n    \n*   [#### I can't see all my paid performance in one place](https://www.wickedreports.com/pricing#)\n    \n    Wicked Reports has deep cost integrations with Facebook, Google, Microsoft / Bing, Pinterest, SnapChat, TikTok and more.\u00a0  \n      \n    This means you can see how all your marketing is working, all in one place. Compare campaigns and ad performance with our ROI grid and compare channels with each other for best performance.\n    \n*   [#### It's hard to setup a marketing attribution software](https://www.wickedreports.com/pricing#)\n    \n    It's easy to setup all your platform integrations inside Wicked Reports. Simply provide authorizations one time, and in under 60 seconds, your accounts are synced with Wicked Reports.\n    \n\n#### **BRANDS  \n  \n****[![Image 22: BOOK-CALL-BLUE@3x](https://www.wickedreports.com/hs-fs/hubfs/BOOK-CALL-BLUE@3x.png?width=163&height=30&name=BOOK-CALL-BLUE@3x.png)](https://www.wickedreports.com/get-wicked-now-nb)  \n**\u00a0\n\n#### **AGENCIES  \n  \n**\n\n[![Image 23: AGENCY-SPECIALIST-CTA-desktop](https://www.wickedreports.com/hs-fs/hubfs/AGENCY-SPECIALIST-CTA-desktop.png?width=416&height=33&name=AGENCY-SPECIALIST-CTA-desktop.png)](https://www.wickedreports.com/video-demo-book-agency-specialist)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n##### WICKED VS\n\nWICKED VS\n\n*   [Wicked Reports vs Hyros](https://www.wickedreports.com/wicked-vs-hyros)\n*   [Wicked Reports vs Triple Whale](https://www.wickedreports.com/wicked-vs-triple-whale)\n*   [Wicked Reports vs Northbeam](https://www.wickedreports.com/wicked-vs-northbeam)\n*   [Wicked Reports vs Google Analytics 4](https://www.wickedreports.com/wicked-reports-vs-google-analytics-4)\n*   [Wicked Reports vs Facebook Pixel](https://www.wickedreports.com/wicked-reports-vs-facebook-pixel)\n\n##### About\n\nAbout\n\n*   [Our Story](https://www.wickedreports.com/our-story)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.wickedreports.com/contact-1)\n*   [Agency Partners](https://www.wickedreports.com/become-partner)\n*   [Partner Directory](https://www.wickedreports.com/partner-directory)\n*   [Pricing](https://www.wickedreports.com/wicked-pricing)\n*   [Demos](https://www.wickedreports.com/demos)\n\n*   [Legal Stuff](https://www.wickedreports.com/terms-conditions/)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.wickedreports.com/privacy)\n\n\u00a9 2025 Wicked Reports LLC.\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/WickedReports/)[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wicked-reports/)[](https://www.youtube.com/c/WickedReports)\n\n[](javascript:)\n\nWicked Reports Pricing - Get Accurate Multi-touch marketing attribution data for Shopify, Klaviyo, ReCharge.",
