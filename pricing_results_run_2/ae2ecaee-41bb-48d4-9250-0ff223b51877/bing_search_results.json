If your account has reached the limit before the end of the one-month period, you won\u2019t receive responses until the next one-month period begins and the counter resets.\n\n##### How do you process payments? What payment methods are available?\n\nWe use [2Checkout](https://www.2checkout.com/) (now Verifone) payment processing to accept payments and collect monthly and yearly subscription fees. 2Checkout meets the highest level of PCI compliance: your personal and payment data are well protected when you make payments with 2Checkout.\n\n2Checkout supports more than 45 payment methods and accepts all types of credit and debit cards. You can choose the desired payment method from the list of payment methods available for your country on the final checkout page.\n\n##### Do you have a money-back guarantee?\n\nYes. If you purchased an AidaForm subscription for the first time, you can try using the service and then request a full refund within 14 days without having to give us a reason.\n\nPlease note that the money-back guarantee does not apply to subscription renewals and purchased extensions like Auto-Replies, Additional Custom Domains, and Additional Storage Space.\n\n##### What\u2019s the difference between yearly and monthly plans?\n\nThe features and benefits are the same. If you purchase an annual subscription, you pay **20%** less compared to the monthly subscriptions.\n\n##### When can I cancel my subscription? What happens after I cancel?\n\nYou can downgrade to the Free plan at any time. In most cases, canceling auto-renew before the end of your subscription means you\u2019ll have access to paid features until the end of your subscription term.\n\nAfter that your account\u2019s plan becomes Free. All your forms and responses will remain available in your AidaForm account, but paid features and fields on your forms will be deactivated.\n\n##### Can I get a partial refund if I cancel a yearly subscription in the middle of the subscription period?\n\nYes, you can. We calculate partial refunds individually. Please [contact our support team](https://aidaform.com/help/contact-support.html) to get the refund.\n\n##### Do you offer discounts for educational institutions and nonprofits?\n\nYes, we are happy to offer educational and non-profit institutions a 30% discount for any AidaForm plan. Please [contact us](https://aidaform.com/help/contact-support.html) to get your personal discount coupon.\n\n##### I have more questions.\n\nPlease [contact us](https://aidaform.com/help/contact-support.html) if you have any other questions or concerns.
