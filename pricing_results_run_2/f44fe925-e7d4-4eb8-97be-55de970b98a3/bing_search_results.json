I got started with Thrive Themes on a recommendation from one of my great friends and mentor. After that, I launched my own Program BYOW (Build Your Own Website)\n\nNow I am training doctors and business owners across India on how they can Build Their Own Websites using Thrive Suite.\n\nThrive has been one of the game changing things that happened in my life. I'm so happy & grateful that I invested in Thrive Themes for my business.\n\n![Image 8](https://mlpxhq8ztvyc.i.optimole.com/cb:p0Z2.44bbf/w:50/h:50/q:mauto/f:best/https://thrivethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Thrive-Customer-Highlights-Square-Dave-Sollis.jpg)\n\nDave Sollis// Coach\n\nI love the Thrive Theme Builder style editor. Being able to set site-wide color schemes and fonts is fantastic.\n\nSo are the ready-made templates. They make it so easy to get a decent looking page built really quickly. I couldn\u2019t believe how fast I was able to create my homepage \u2013 complete with blog post grid and newsletter sign-ups.\n\nThrive Apprentice is also great and has been a real lifesaver for me too. \\[My course\\] is now completely in my control. I\u2019m no longer at the mercy of a course platform.\n\n![Image 9](https://mlpxhq8ztvyc.i.optimole.com/cb:p0Z2.44bbf/w:50/h:50/q:mauto/f:best/https://thrivethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thrive-Customer-Highlights-Square-Idan-Kirshner.jpg)\n\nIdan Kirchner\u00a0 // Yoga teacher\n\nThrive has helped me turn my passion for yoga into a real, online business I was able to build my dream life around.\n\nTheir tools are fast, reliable, and always improving.\n\n![Image 10](https://mlpxhq8ztvyc.i.optimole.com/cb:p0Z2.44bbf/w:50/h:50/q:mauto/f:best/https://thrivethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Thrive-Customer-Highlights-Square-Daniel-David-Wallace.jpg)\n\nDaniel David Wallace// Coach\n\nI have a course business, a coaching business, and more recently I run events for my audience.\n\nI think people should use Thrive Theme Builder and Apprentice to build a really great website, and then use tools like Thrive Leads and other lead-building tools within Thrive Suite to really focus on building up an email list.\n\nI can't wait to see more Thrive Themes features in the future.\n\n![Image 11](https://mlpxhq8ztvyc.i.optimole.com/cb:p0Z2.44bbf/w:50/h:50/q:mauto/f:best/https://thrivethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Thrive-Customer-Highlights-Square-Claire-Gervais.jpg)\n\nClaire Gervais// Coach\n\nThrive Themes was the best investment I made for my business.\n\nI can literally do everything I want, from adding a punky design all over my site with the woosh of a click, to zooming in on my potential customers thanks to cool opt-ins and popups.\n\nWithout it, I think working on my website would be as hard and frustrating as a day without a good ol' cup of dark coffee 70% Arabica 30% Robusta (Kenyan is the best).\n\n![Image 12](https://mlpxhq8ztvyc.i.optimole.com/cb:p0Z2.44bbf/w:50/h:50/q:mauto/f:best/https://thrivethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Thrive-Customer-Highlights-Square-Viola-Eva.jpg)\n\nViola Eva // SEO Agency\n\nI am a digital marketer and SEO, this means that I work with websites day in and day out. However, I am neither a web designer nor web developer - but I want a good-looking site that is easy to update.\n\nI look at so many WordPress websites for my clients and a lot of them have a clunky backend, or they need design and development resources to make updates. This is why I love using Thrive Suite on my website - everything is in my control.\n\nThe builders are easy to use and, if I ever have a question, the Thrive team has surely covered it with a video.\n\nAnd best of all - my complete lack of design skills is compensated by the templated building Blocks. WordPress is often a mess of plugins that don\u2019t talk to each other or cause problems when updating, not so with Thrive Themes where everything runs smoothly. I can not recommend them enough!\n\n#### Read more stories from real Thrive Suite customers [here.](https://thrivethemes.com/thrive-suite-customers/)\n\n**FAQ**\n-------\n\nHere are answers to some common questions about the Thrive Suite.\n\n#### What's included in Thrive Suite?\n\nThrive Suite includes\n\n\\- All our plugins: Thrive Architect, Thrive Leads, Thrive Quiz Builder, Thrive Apprentice, Thrive Comments, Thrive Ovation, Thrive Optimize & Thrive Ultimatum\n\n\\- Thrive Theme Builder and the companion themes Shapeshift, Ommi and Kwik\n\n\\- Unlimited support as long as your Thrive Suite license is in good standing\n\n\\- Unlimited updates as long as your Thrive Suite license is in good standing\n\n\\- Full access to premium templates\n\n#### Can I use this to build my blog?\n\nThrive Suite is perfect if you're starting a blog.
