Can't find the answer you're looking for? Please chat to our team.\n\n*   How does the free trial work?\n    \n    If you [start a 14-day free trial](https://nationbuilder.com/create) of our Starter or Pro plan, you'll have complete access to the NationBuilder platform (with the exception of sending email blasts). We'll send resources to help get you started, and then at the end of the trial period, your account will roll into an annual or monthly subscription on the plan and setting you've selected. At any time during your trial period, you can visit the \u201cSettings\u201d tab in your Control Panel to change your plan type and select any add-ons you choose to include once your trial ends. If you're interested in learning more about our Enterprise plans, [fill out the contact form](https://nationbuilder.com/enterprise_contact) and our team will be in touch.\n    \n*   What are my billing options and when will I be charged?\n    \n    For your convenience, you can choose between monthly and annual billing. Monthly billing is based on the number of people in your database at the time of billing each month, as well as any add-ons or bundles you include in your plan for that month. You get a discount for prepaying on annual billing, and any increases in the number of people in your database or add-on features are discounted as well. Customers on our Starter and Pro plans can expect to pay 20% more on monthly billing than they would on annual billing.\n    \n    Your credit card won't be charged until the conclusion of your 14-day free trial. At that time, you'll be charged the monthly price of the plan you select when you start your trial. If you choose to change your selected plan, you can do so at any time in the Settings tab of your NationBuilder control panel. If you'd like to send an email blast or purchase any add on features, you can do after your trial ends, or choose to convert out of trial early by taking one of those actions.\n    \n*   What is an add-on, and how can I incorporate one into my plan?\n    \n    Add-ons are packs and bundles of additional features you can purchase to customize your NationBuilder plan for your organization and your use case. Add ons are available for an additional monthly cost to help you supercharge your organizing work.\n    \n    Add ons can be purchased within the Account Settings of your Control Panel in the Add-Ons tab of the Contacts and billing section once you complete your 14-day free trial.\n    \n*   What if I want to cancel my plan or add-on?\n    \n    You can shut down your nation at any time and you will not be charged. You own your own data, so you can always do a full export of your database before you cancel.\n    \n    Add-ons are available on a monthly basis, so if you anticipate that you won't need your added-on features anymore, you can always remove them. If you'd like to resume, you can add them back to your plan again via \\[your account settings within the Control Panel\\]. Our goal, though, is to provide you with features that can help you grow, and that you'll want to keep using them to make your organizing efforts that much more effective.\n    \n\n[Read the full FAQ](https://support.nationbuilder.com/en/articles/4143996-pricing-faqs)\n\n> \u201cWe have found the switch to Nationbuilder has increased engagement in our campaigns.
