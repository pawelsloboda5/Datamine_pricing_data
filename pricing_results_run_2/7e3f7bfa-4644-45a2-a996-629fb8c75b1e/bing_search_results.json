After the trial is over, your recurring billing cycle will begin. Recharge follows a monthly billing cycle. You will be billed after the first full billing cycle you complete, not including the free trial period.\n\n### How does pricing work?\n\nDepending on the plan you select, your total monthly charges will include a fixed monthly fee, plus variable fees based on your usage in the most recent billing cycle. Please review the pricing plans to compare your options.\n\n### How is usage-based pricing calculated?\n\nUsage fees differ by plan and apply to all transactions processed by Recharge per month. A \u201ctransaction\u201d is an order that has a subscription product and includes mixed cart scenario where a consumer has both a subscription product and a one-time product in the order.\n\n### Is the pricing for Recharge distinct from ecommerce platform fees?\n\nYes. All pricing for Recharge is in addition to any other services or solutions your store may utilize, such as your ecommerce platform, payment processor, and any other ecommerce applications.\n\n### Is pricing for Recharge any different for merchants on Shopify Plus?\n\nMerchants using Shopify Plus may be eligible for discounted pricing through our Custom plan. Please [contact our Sales team](https://rechargepayments.com/talk-to-sales/) for more information.\n\n### Can I negotiate a lower usage fee for my store?\n\nYes. Through the Custom plan, tailored pricing, which includes discounts, is available to merchants with high [processing](https://rechargepayments.com/glossary/order-processing/) volumes.
