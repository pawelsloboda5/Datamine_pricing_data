No Monthly Fees**.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe only make money from processing fees. We keep our fees low by having a self-serve and easy-to-use platform. Processing fees can be paid by your registrants, absorbed by your organization, or split 50/50. Give donors the option to pay the processing fee to make their donation go further. Registrants can save even more when purchasing as a family or a group. **Our processing fees are charged per cart total \u2014 not per ticket or registration.**\n\nWhen your event is free, so is the processing fee. There are no processing fees for free events. Free is free.\n\n**Slide to See** Your Event Processing Fee\n------------------------------------------\n\nEvent price Per Participant\n\n_$_\n\nParticipants Per Transaction\n\nCart Total\\*\n\n$50.00\n\n\\* The cart total determines the rate of the processing fee.

Every customer gets free websites, free email, free built-in marketing tools, a free RaceDay Day app, a free photo platform, automated sales tax management, chargeback management, and more. No upselling and no limits.\n\n![Image 4](https://info.runsignup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/smile.png)\n\n![Image 5](https://info.runsignup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/stop.png)\n\n### ****No subscriptions, no monthly fees, no long-term contracts****\n\nOur only revenue is from processing fees, meaning you\u2019ll never pay a subscription or monthly fee. And because we only want happy customers, there are no long-term contracts \u2013 you\u2019re free to use our technology for an event with no commitment.\n\n### **Low fees**\n\nDespite our robust set of features, we keep our fees low with an easy-to-use self-serve platform. This helps keep your costs down, and comes with another benefit: you have full control over every aspect of your event.\n\n![Image 6](https://info.runsignup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/low.png)\n\n![Image 7](https://info.runsignup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled-6.png)\n\n### **Families and Groups Save More**\n\nOur processing fees are per cart total, not per person. This means families and groups who sign up together together save money \u2013 a real benefit if you\u2019re using pricing strategies to encourage bulk ticket purchases!\n\n### **Free events are free**\n\nNo cost to the event? No processing fee. Free is free (for once).\n\n![Image 8](https://info.runsignup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/free2.png)\n\n![Image 9](https://info.runsignup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/low1.png)\n\n* * *\n\nPricing FAQ\n-----------\n\nHave questions about the pricing above? We have some answers.\n\nReally? There are no other charges?\n\nWe don\u2019t charge for anything else on our platform. We only charge a processing fee as explained above.\n\nCan I pass the processing fee onto my participants?\n\nWe allow event directors to set flexible payment options for their fees. Processing fees can be paid by the participant, absorbed by the event, or split 50\u201350%.\n\nWhat about donations?\n\nNonprofits can keep donation costs down with a simple donation processing fee of 4%. Donation processing rate is dependent on an event\u2019s organization type and choice of payment option.\n\nCan I opt to ADD to processing fees?\n\nYes, larger customers in the Partner Program can set their own, higher processing fees and keep the difference as an additional source of revenue.",
