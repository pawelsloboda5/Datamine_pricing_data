The leap forward in customer training that Skilljar allowed was customizing the interface for our users. The API connections pull data for each user, so we can send them to the right landing page, and the most appropriate training will be highlighted on those pages. This wasn't possible with our previous system.\u201d\n\n\u2014VP, Product Education, Mid-Market\n\n### FAQs\n\nWhat is an active user?\n\nAn active user is someone who consumes or interacts with a lesson in your Academy. We estimate active users annually, and track actual usage monthly. As you grow, the cost per active user decreases. For example, if you estimate 5,000 active users annually and actually have 100 in January and 400 in February, you'll have 4,500 active users left for the rest of the year.\n\nDo I pay for users that log into my Academy?\n\nNo, you only pay for _active_ users, users who register for and consume content with their email address.\n\nHow much is each active user?\n\nWe offer tiered pricing\u2014the more active users you have, the lower the cost per user. Contact our Sales team for specific details.\n\nHow can I estimate my active users?\n\nIf you have a current Learning Management System, check your monthly unique logged-in learners. If you\u2019re new to LMS, our Sales team can provide some benchmarks to estimate based on your use case for your Academy. For example, if your Academy is focused on onboarding new customers, we recommend looking at how many new customers you\u2019re onboarding per month and applying a percentage you want to reach with training. If you have a Help Center, this can be another helpful proxy to understand the number of customers looking for educational content.\n\nIs there a cap on active users per month?\n\nNo, you have a yearly allocation. For example, let\u2019s say you estimate 5,000 annual active users. If you have 100 active users in January and 400 active users in February, you will have 4,500 active users remaining for the year.\n\nIs a user counted more than once if they log in multiple times in a month?\n\nNo, a user is only counted once per month, even if they log in and consume content multiple times. For example, if a user views content in your Academy everyday of the year, they are considered 12 active users against your annual bucket of active users.\n\nCan I add additional active users at any time?\n\nYes, reach out to your Account Manager to add more active users.\n\nWhat is the difference between each Skilljar pricing plan?\n\nPlans differ in the number of Academy sites, admin role types, and integrations. If you sell your courses, you may want to consider upgrading to Professional or Enterprise for more currencies and access to our Content Syndication feature to embed your courses in other LMSs.\n\nWhat integrations do you offer?\n\nWe offer integrations with the most common tools in your tech stack, such as Salesforce, Gainsight, Zoom, Credly, Stripe and Zendesk. See the full list [here](https://www.skilljar.com/integrations).\n\nWhat can I expect during a demo or pricing call with your Sales team?\n\nOur team will walk you through Skilljar\u2019s features, learn about your education program goals, and answer your questions.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Skilljar Dashboard, an Academy site, a Test Academy, and a Sandbox Org?\n\n*   Skilljar Dashboard: The back-end Learning Management System your education team uses to manage learning content, enroll students and see analytics\n*   Academy Site: The front-end learner experience where your learners access your content (e.g., academy.company.com)\n*   Test Academy: A test Academy site so you can preview courses or theming before going live (e.g. test-company.skilljar.com)\n*   Sandbox Org: A separate Skilljar Dashboard environment to test integrations and data connectors without affecting your Academy\u00a0site.\n\nWhat are the various administrative roles that come with each plan?\n\nWe offer 14 admin roles. Our Essentials plan includes any 6 roles, and Professional or Enterprise plans include all roles. You can view [detailed permissions for each in our Help Center.](https://support.skilljar.com/hc/en-us/articles/18631929431699-Skilljar-Dashboard-Roles-and-Permissions)\n\nWhat is Content Syndication?\n\nSkilljar\u2019s Content Syndication allows you to create and host your courses in Skilljar, then distribute them directly to any LMS your customers use, all while retaining full ownership and control. With live updates and comprehensive analytics, you can deliver a consistent and engaging learning experience for all users.\n\nWhat is External Management?\n\nSkilljar\u2019s External Management is a secure way to delegate student management without giving external users access to your back-end dashboard. Skilljar admin can assign external \"Student Managers\" who can add new students, enroll them in specified content, and track their progress\u2014directly from your branded Academy. This capability allows you to offload administrative tasks while maintaining complete control over what Student Managers can do.\n\nWhat are Actions and Automations?\n\nSkilljar Actions help you create custom workflows that run themselves so you can spend less time on manual tasks. Actions give you the ability to automate common learner management tasks. Using actions, you can automatically add a learner to a group, remove a learner from a group, or enroll a learner in any course.\n\n![Image 5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f2e85a59750ccb710adbf3/661e8f771ff1af64b7c1fc7d_grid%20pattern.svg)![Image 6](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f2e85a59750ccb710adbf3/661e8f771ff1af64b7c1fc7d_grid%20pattern.svg)![Image 7](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f2e85a59750ccb710adbf3/661e8f771ff1af64b7c1fc7d_grid%20pattern.svg)![Image 8](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f2e85a59750ccb710adbf3/661e8f771ff1af64b7c1fc7d_grid%20pattern.svg)\n\nWe're here to help\n------------------\n\nNot ready to talk yet?
