Slack does not share customer data with large language model (LLM) providers and does not use customer data to train LLMs. [Visit our Help Center for more details](https://slack.com/help/articles/25076892548883-Introducing--Slack-AI#faqs).\n\nOur large language models are hosted directly within Slack\u2019s AWS virtual private cloud, ensuring your data remains in-house.\n\nYou can use a credit card to pay for any plan. If you choose to pay annually, you may be eligible to be invoiced and pay by ACH or wire transfer. [Visit our Help Center](https://slack.com/help/articles/360002038947-Supported-payment-methods#pay-by-invoice) for more details, or contact us to start the process.\n\nIf you choose to pay by credit card, you\u2019ll see the first credit card charge from Slack on the day you purchase a paid plan. Here are some other times you\u2019ll see charges:\n\n*   On your monthly renewal date if you pay monthly.\n*   On your annual renewal date if you pay annually.\n*   On the last day of the month if you pay annually and there\u2019s an outstanding balance for adding new members.\n\nYou can change billing cycles or switch to invoicing at any time. Learn more about managing billing details [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/218915087-Manage-your-Slack-plan-and-billing-details#change-your-billing-cycle).\n\nAt Slack, we believe you should only be billed for what you use. Members who take an action in Slack at any time within a 28-day period will be considered active for billing purposes. If someone you\u2019ve already paid for becomes inactive, we\u2019ll add a prorated credit to your account for the unused time.\n\nYou\u2019ll be charged a prorated amount for new team members for the remainder of the current billing period.\n\nAs an example, suppose your team is on the Pro plan, which costs $8.75 USD per active user per month (when billed monthly). You add a new member 10 days into your billing period with 20 days remaining in the month. The per-day cost for each user is $8.75 divided by 30, so we\u2019ll make a one-time charge of $5.83 ($8.75 divided by 30 days times 20 days) to the credit card on file.\n\nFor a detailed overview of our billing model and how your subscription term affects when you will be billed, [visit the Help Center](https://slack.com/help/articles/218915077-Slacks-Fair-Billing-Policy).\n\nGet more information on [billing at Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201723133-billing-faq).\n\nGet more information  \non [billing at Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201723133-billing-faq).\n\nFind the Slack plan that best fits your company.

Here\u2019s how to buy Slack AI:\n\n*   If you haven\u2019t signed up for Slack, [create a workspace](https://slack.com/get-started?entry_point=pricing_page#/createnew%22) to get started. You can [upgrade your workspace](https://my.slack.com/pricing) and purchase the Slack AI add-on at the same time.

Then log in to desktop to [upgrade your workspace](https://my.slack.com/pricing) and purchase the Slack AI add-on at the same time. To do so, select a paid subscription and then click on **With Slack AI**.\n*   If you\u2019re on the Pro or Business+ subscription, sign in to your account on desktop and [click **Get Slack AI** on the Pricing page](https://my.slack.com/pricing).\n\nOn Enterprise Grid?

Slack does not share customer data with large language model (LLM) providers and does not use customer data to train LLMs. [Visit our Help Centre for more details](https://slack.com/help/articles/25076892548883-Introducing--Slack-AI#faqs).\n\nOur large language models are hosted directly within Slack\u2019s AWS virtual private cloud, ensuring that your data remains in-house.\n\nYou can use a credit card to pay for any subscription. If you choose to pay annually, you may be eligible to be invoiced and pay by ACH or bank transfer. [Visit our Help Centre](https://slack.com/help/articles/360002038947-Supported-payment-methods#pay-by-invoice) for more details, or contact us to start the process.\n\nIf you choose to pay by credit card, you\u2019ll see the first credit card charge from Slack on the day that you purchase a paid subscription. Here are some other times when you\u2019ll see charges:\n\n*   On your monthly renewal date if you pay monthly.\n*   On your annual renewal date if you pay annually.\n*   On the last day of the month if you pay annually and there\u2019s an outstanding balance for adding new members.\n\nYou can change billing cycles or switch to invoicing at any time. Learn more about managing billing details [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/218915087-Manage-your-Slack-plan-and-billing-details#change-your-billing-cycle).\n\nAt Slack, we believe that you should only be billed for what you use. Members who take an action in Slack at any time within a 28-day period will be considered active for billing purposes. If someone that you\u2019ve already paid for becomes inactive, we\u2019ll add a prorated credit to your account for the unused time.\n\nYou\u2019ll be charged a prorated amount for new team members for the remainder of the current billing period.\n\nAs an example, suppose your team is on the Pro subscription, which costs $8.75 USD per active user per month (when billed monthly). You add a new member ten days into your billing period, with 20 days remaining in the month. The per-day cost for each user is $8.75 USD divided by 30, so we\u2019ll make a one-time charge of $5.83 USD ($8.75 USD divided by 30 days times 20 days) to the credit card on file.\n\nFor a detailed overview of our billing model and how your subscription term affects when you will be billed, [visit the Help Centre](https://slack.com/help/articles/218915077-Slacks-Fair-Billing-Policy).\n\nGet more information on [billing at Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-gb/articles/201723133-billing-faq).\n\nGet more information  \non [billing at Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-gb/articles/201723133-billing-faq).\n\nFind the Slack subscription that best fits your company.
