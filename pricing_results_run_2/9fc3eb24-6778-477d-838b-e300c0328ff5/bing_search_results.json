The number of sign ups in which you can simultaneously remove ads from depends on your subscription level. This feature can be rolled forward to future sign ups. As one sign up ends, you can re-apply the ad removal feature to a different sign up.](javascript:;)\n\nNo ads on  \n1 sign up\n\nNo ads on  \n10 sign ups\n\nPremium designs\n\nHide number wanted\n\n[With a premium plan, you can hide the number wanted (quantity) for your slot entry. Your sign up will display the number of participants signed up without showing the number available. This feature is most helpful when you don't need to specify the maximum number of people you wish to sign up.](javascript:;)\n\nCustom sign up themes\n\n[Create the perfect event sign up sheet with our custom theme editor. Upload your images and choose from 12 layout options, including multiple photo designs. You can also access our stock library with thousands of images.](javascript:;)\n\nMultiple tabbed sign ups\n\n[Sign Up Tabbing is a powerful feature when you have an event that is too large to organize on a single sign up page - like teacher conferences for a large school. Users can group related sign up sheets together by creating a set of tabs at the top of their sign up pages. The tabs provide an easy way for participants to quickly navigate between multiple sign up pages.](javascript:;)\n\nBack to website button\n\n[Customize a button to direct participants to a website other than SignUpGenius after they complete the sign up process. The button will show prominently on the \"Thank You\" page and can be customized to any URL.](javascript:;)\n\nCustom sign up link\n\n[Want to customize the web address of your sign up page? No problem! Every sign up has a web link assigned to it automatically that you will be able to access when your sign up is taken live. With Platinum and Enterprise plans, subscribers can personalize those sign up links. Customizing the link is great for branding and can make sharing sign up page easier on printed materials.](javascript:;)\n\nSlot images\n\n[Upload and add images to your sign up slots to help each opportunity stand out uniquely on the page. Adding images can be done easily right within the builder with a Platinum or Enterprise account.](javascript:;)\n\nEmbeddable sign ups\n\n[Enterprise plan subscribers can embed sign ups directly onto their website to create a seamless sign up experience for participants. Perfect for coordinating registration or fundraising events, this feature saves time and money by providing a sign up form that works as an extension of your website instead of having to develop your own custom application.](javascript:;)\n\nSignUpGenius brand removal\n\n[With our brand removal feature, you can remove all SignUpGenius branding from your sign up web pages. Customize the look of sign ups to match your brand and remove all SignUpGenius logos to give it the look and feel of your own website.](javascript:;)\n\nCustom portal pages\n\n[Create a customized index page that directs your audience to the right sign ups and more. The page works like a website's home page for sign ups. The sign up organizer can choose which sign ups appear on the page, add sections to the page, such as important files or an email opt-in subscription form, and even customize the URL.](javascript:;)\n\n### Admin Features\n\nAdditional admins on sign ups\n\n[Delegate organizing responsibilities when you assign additional administrators to one SignUpGenius account. This feature also makes it easy to customize and limit each admin's permission levels. Need unlimited administrators? Contact our team to learn about enterprise plans.](javascript:;)\n\n10\n\n20\n\nCustomized\n\nCloud file storage\n\n500MB\n\n1GB\n\n3GB\n\nCustomized\n\nCollect money\n\n[Simplify how you collect payments and fees for your business, fundraisers and events. By activating the collect money feature on your account, sign up organizers can charge fees, issue refunds and offer discounts to their participants. SignUpGenius payments, powered by Stripe, makes it easy to collect money for your group! Access this feature under the Tools icon in your sign up dashboard.](javascript:;)\n\nSync entire sign up calendar\n\nAuto-hide dates on sign ups\n\n[Ideal for large, ongoing sign ups with many dates. Automatically hide dates in the past so that old slots drop off the page as they pass, and the most current available slots stay at the top of the page. In addition, you can set up your sign up so it will only display dates a certain number of days in the future. If you hide future dates, slots will automatically show up on the page when the time gets within the specified range.](javascript:;)\n\nSign up start/stop dates\n\n[Perfect for events where slots are limited or in high demand. Set up a sign up page to automatically start accepting sign ups at a specific date/time or to lock after a certain date/time to prevent more people from signing up. You can even choose to lock users from editing/deleting their sign up items after the sign up is closed or to show alternate text on your page based on date.](javascript:;)\n\nSign up locking by date\n\n[Prevent last-minute changes by volunteers before an event with this feature. It allows you to stop group members from either signing up or changing their sign up slot as it gets close to the day of the event. You can customize the number of days before the event that you want the lock to take place.](javascript:;)\n\nFile attachments on sign ups\n\nAdvanced quantity limits\n\n[Allows you to put restrictions on a sign up so that your participants are prevented from signing up for more items than you would like them to. You can restrict the total quantity that a user can sign up for across your entire sign up page or you can put a restriction on the quantity for each individual item on the page.](javascript:;)\n\nAPI access\n\n500  \nrequests/day\n\n2,000  \nrequests/day\n\n5,000  \nrequests/day\n\nCustomized\n\nWaitlist on sign ups\n\n[With a Gold and above plan, you can add a waitlist to your slot to allow participants to sign up if the slot is full. The first participant on the waitlist will be automatically moved from the waitlist to the slot if a spot opens up. A waitlist cannot be added if payments are being collected. The admin can also manage the waitlist manually if necessary.](javascript:;)\n\nGoogle reCAPTCHA\n\n[Enabling this setting will activate Google reCAPTCHA on the sign up form. reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive challenges to keep bots from filling sign up slots while allowing legitimate participants to sign up with ease. This ensures that everyone has an equal opportunity to sign up.](javascript:;)\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO)\n\nDedicated account manager\n\n### Communication\n\nEmail invites/group messages\n\n2,500/month\n\n10,000/month\n\n20,000/month\n\nCustomized\n\nText invites/group updates\n\n[Send text messages to group members including links to your sign ups and important information such as location changes or cancellations. Participants can easily opt-in to receive your messages and opt-out later if needed. Choose a subscription level based on the total number of messages needed per month.](javascript:;)\n\n150/month\n\n500/month\n\n1,500/month\n\nCustomized\n\nEmail attachments\n\nThemed email invites\n\n[Look like an event-organizing genius with themed emails to match your sign ups. Custom images loaded to your sign up page will also be sent in your emails to create the perfect branding for your event.](javascript:;)\n\nCustom  \nreminders/confirmations\n\n[Premium users can customize the content of the automated reminder messages that are sent to their participants and choose to have a confirmation email sent to their participants immediately after they sign up.](javascript:;)\n\nEmail scheduling\n\nCustom QR code\n\n[Want to simplify how you share your sign up to participants? Look no further! Gold, Platinum and Enterprise subscribers can generate a unique, easy-to-scan QR code for their sign ups. Having a personalized QR code is great for branding and can make sharing your sign up easier on printed materials. By scanning the QR code, participants will be taken directly to your sign up link. You can access and retrieve a QR code from the Share tab at any time after a sign up is published.](javascript:;)\n\n### Reports & Tracking\n\nVolunteer hours reports\n\n[Run reports to see how many hours each volunteer signed up to serve for one or more events. You can run reports across multiple sign ups and even group hours tracked for sets of people. That way, if you want to know how many hours a family, a class or a subcommittee served, you can run a report and set it up by the volunteer groupings you choose.](javascript:;)\n\nEmail click-through
