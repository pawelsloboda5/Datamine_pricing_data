We want you to use and stay with NiceJob because you\u2019re getting value out of our reputation marketing platform.\n\nWhat's my billing date?\n\nYour billing date will be the day your 14-day trial ends or, if you sign up after the trial ends, on _that_ date.\n\nWill my bill be emailed to me?\n\nYes.

Along with the features in the Reviews plan, you'll have access to AI replies features, Get Repeats campaigns, in-depth competitor insights, and more.\u00a0  \n  \nWhat's this mean? You'll be able to get more bookings easily by enrolling your customers in automated campaigns, enhance your services by keeping an eye on your competitor reviews, and reply to all of your valuable customers without lifting a finger.\n\nDoes NiceJob have integrations with other apps or software?\n\nYes!

How much do additional landing pages and blogs cost?\n\nIf you\u2019d like additional landing pages on your fully-managed website, there\u2019s a one-time cost of $145 per page and an additional $15/month per page to your subscription.\n\nIf you\u2019d like a CMS for Blogs, Services or Locations that you control, there\u2019s a one-time $245 setup cost per CMS and an additional $15/month per CMS to your subscription.\n\nI\u2019m a Sites customer. Is there a discount for getting multiple landing pages?\n\nThinking of adding a lot of landing pages? Reach out to NiceJob Sites support at [convert@nicejob.com](mailto:convert@nicejob.com) to see what options may be best for you!\n\nMy question isn\u2019t listed here.
