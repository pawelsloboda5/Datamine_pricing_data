It is used to hold files uploaded through the File Upload field. It is calculated across all forms on an account and the maximum size of file attachments that can be uploaded is 25MB.\n    \n*   [### FREE Account Limits](https://www.wufoo.com/pricing/#)\n    \n    On FREE accounts, forms will be deactivated once they have exceeded the maximum number of entries allowed for a given month.\n    \n*   [### Overages](https://www.wufoo.com/pricing/#)\n    \n    On PAID accounts, if you exceed the number of entries allowed for the month, a fee of $0.05 USD per entry over the limit will be charged to your account at the end of your billing period. All prices are $ USD unless otherwise noted.\n    \n*   [### Maximum Number of Fields](https://www.wufoo.com/pricing/#)\n    \n    Because checkboxes and text areas are handled differently on the database side in Wufoo, the maximum number of fields you can have on a form isn\u2019t set in stone and is dependent on the type of data you\u2019re collecting. Generally, this is about 100 fields, but it is limited by the number of checkbox (each choice counts as a field) and paragraph fields. Paragraph fields take up a lot more space on the database and so a maximum of 10 are allowed on a form.\n    \n*   [### Customer Support](https://www.wufoo.com/pricing/#)\n    \n    Customer support is handled via email. Our team is available Monday-Friday between 6AM and 5PM PST.
