You can add as many contacts as you like. CallFire will never charge you a per contact fee.\n\n### [How are calls billed?](https://www.callfire.com/pricing-plans#)\n\nAll calls are billed in sixty-second increments, from pickup to hang-up. We bill the length of the call, and not the length of the message that you are sending. This means, for example, that messages left with answering machines will last longer than calls that are answered live. The per-minute cost of the call will depend on the billing plan that you choose.\n\n### [What happens if I call over my plan allowance?](https://www.callfire.com/pricing-plans#)\n\nIf your allowance reaches 0 credits, your calls and texts will stop. You can upgrade your plan to resume calling, or purchase additional credits at 5\u00a2 per credit.\n\n### [Can I upgrade my plan?](https://www.callfire.com/pricing-plans#)\n\nOf course! When you select a plan upgrade from our basic pay-as-you-go level, the new plan will take effect immediately. If your account is already on a monthly plan, the new rates will take effect at the beginning of your next billing period. In the interim you can still purchase additional credits at your current plan rate.\n\n### [Can I downgrade my plan?](https://www.callfire.com/pricing-plans#)\n\nIf you choose to downgrade your plan, it will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle. Until then, you will continue to be billed at your current plan rate.\n\n### [Does my allowance of minutes expire?](https://www.callfire.com/pricing-plans#)\n\nYes. The allowance of minutes you purchase each cycle will expire at the end of the cycle.\n\n### [Does my plan include international calls and texting?](https://www.callfire.com/pricing-plans#)\n\nYour plan includes calls to the US and Canada. Our legacy platform supports international dialing. For international rates, view our [international pricing](https://www.callfire.com/products/international) page for more information. CallFire does not currently support international text messages.\n\n@media (max-width: 767px) { .section-pricing .pricing-plans .col-12 col-md-3:last-child h2.plan-name span {font-size: 11px;} } @media (max-width: 767px) { .section-pricing .pricing-plans .col-12 col-md-3:last-child h2.plan-name span {font-size: 11px;} } .page #hero { background: #f6f6f6; padding-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 365px; text-align: center; } .page #hero h1 { font-size: 54px; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #252525; } .page .benefits { display: none; } .section-pricing-plans #hero, .section-precios #hero { background",
