You can renew your membership two weeks before it is set to expire. If your membership expires, you will be downgraded to a Basic Membership. You will be notified at the start of the week and the day before this happens.\n\nNavigate\n\n[Home](https://www.guru.com/index.aspx?Ref=login.aspx \"Home\") [Post a Job](https://www.guru.com/registeraccount.aspx?ReturnUrl=hire/post/ \"Post a Job\") [Find a Freelancer](https://www.guru.com/d/freelancers/ \"Find a Freelancer\") [Find a Job](https://www.guru.com/d/jobs/ \"Find a Job\") [Enterprise Solutions](https://www.guru.com/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Solutions\") [Agency Solutions](https://www.guru.com/agency/ \"Agency Solutions\") [PO Solutions](https://www.guru.com/purchase-orders/ \"Purchase Order Solutions\")\n\nCompany Info\n\n[About Guru](https://www.guru.com/about/ \"About Us\") [How Guru Works](https://www.guru.com/how-it-works/ \"How it Works\") [Why Guru](https://www.guru.com/why-guru/ \"Why Guru\") [Work Agreements](https://www.guru.com/agreements/ \"Work Agreements\") [SafePay](https://www.guru.com/safepay/ \"SafePay\") [Pricing](https://www.guru.com/pricing-employer/ \"Pricing\")\n\nResources\n\n[Help & FAQ](https://www.guru.com/help/ \"Help & FAQ\") [Blog](https://www.guru.com/blog/ \"Blog\") [Contact Us](https://www.guru.com/contact.aspx \"Contact Us\") [Mobile App](https://www.guru.com/app/ \"Mobile App\") [APIs](https://www.guru.com/apihelp/help.html \"APIs\") [Sitemap](https://www.guru.com/sitemap/ \"sitemap\") Cookie Settings\n\nPolicies\n\n[IP Policy](https://www.guru.com/trademark-copyright-policy/ \"IP Policy\") [Privacy Policy](https://www.guru.com/privacy-policy/ \"Privacy Policy\") [Terms of Service](https://www.guru.com/terms-of-service/ \"Terms of Service\")\n\nConnect With Us\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/GuruFreelancing/ \"Connect with Guru on Facebook\") [](https://x.com/GuruFreelancing \"Connect with Guru on X\") [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gurufreelancing/ \"Connect with Guru on LinkedIn\")\n\nGet the Guru App\n\n [![Image 1: Download iOS App](https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/f_auto/v1721825665/static/homepage/app/icon-apple_ubj02s.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/websoft-inc/id1551376616)[![Image 2: Download Android App](https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/f_auto/v1721825665/static/homepage/app/icon-android_ydespj.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8502258576761407444&hl=en)\n\n[](https://www.guru.com/ \"Guru Home\")| Get Work Done\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025, Guru.com\n\n \n\nPrivacy Preference Center\n-------------------------\n\nGuru.com uses cookies to provide necessary website functionality, improve user experience, and analyze traffic.
