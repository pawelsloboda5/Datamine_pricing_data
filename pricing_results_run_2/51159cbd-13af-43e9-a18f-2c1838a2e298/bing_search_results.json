The free plan is and always will be 100% free. For the majority of our users, the free plan is more than enough, but if it's not, we have upgrades.\n    \n*   Do you have any enterprise plans?\n    \n    YES! Our [time tracking software](https://www.jibble.io/) is built for teams of all shapes and sizes. Get in touch with us if you have a team larger than 500 and we'll set you up with a plan that works best for you.\n    \n*   How are users counted?\n    \n    For Annual plans, you purchase \"seats\" for one year up front. These seats can be replaced with other users. If you decide on a monthly plan, you only pay for the users that are in your team during a month.\n    \n*   Do you give discounts?\n    \n    To be fair to all our customers, those with fewer than 500 users will pay the prices listed above. Customers with more than 500 users will receive fixed bulk discounts on these prices based on volume.\n    \n*   How can I cancel my subscription?\n    \n    You can cancel or downgrade your subscription at any time.\n    \n*   What payment methods do you accept?\n    \n    We accept all major credit cards and PayPal. We don\u2019t collect credit card details but use the trusted 3rd party Stripe as a credit card gateway. Your credit card details will be held by them in their secure digital vault.\n    \n*   My staff number varies significantly. Do you have a plan where you only charge for users that used Jibble?\n    \n    We offer custom plans designed to accommodate teams of all sizes. Contact us, and we'll help you find the perfect plan that scales seamlessly with your team!\n    \n\n*   ![Image 1: Tesla logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tesla_logo_PNG21-e1651726733892-1.png.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 2: JLL logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2560px-JLL_logo-3-e1670918938902.png.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 3: Pizza Hut logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kisspng-pizza-hut-restaurant-kyle-papa-john-s-pizza-hut-logo-5b1343c28396c5.340917241527989186539-300x78-1.png.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 4: Ayala logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ayala-min.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 5: NHS logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NHS-2.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 6: Harvard Medical School logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Harvard-Medical-School.png.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 7: Hyundai logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/hyundai-logo-png-transparent-e1651728350228.png.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 8: Neom logo text only](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/neom-logo-text-saudi-arabia.png.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 9: Lambda logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lambda-1.png.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 10: Maxis logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Frame-634172.png.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 11: Medical College Wisconsin logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Frame-634227.png.webp)\n    \n*   ![Image 12: Cepco logo](https://www.jibble.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Cepco.png.webp)\n\nFree time tracking app. Used by 10,000's users worldwide, from SME to enterprise.
