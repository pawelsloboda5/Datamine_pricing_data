Do I need a credit card to try Productboard?\n\nYou can sign up for a free trial for free, no credit card needed. Once your trial ends, you can use our Starter plan for free or purchase one of our paid plans to continue using Productboard.\n\nHow do I purchase? What forms of payment do you accept - credit card and/or invoicing?\n\nYou can buy our Essentials and Pro plans through Productboard\u2019s billing page using all major credit cards. To purchase the Enterprise plan and get set up on invoicing, please\u00a0[**contact our sales team**](https://www.productboard.com/pricing/#form1071).\n\nWhat are the different roles and their associated access? Which roles do I pay for?\n\nCustomers pay for the number of makers using Productboard. A **maker** has full access to edit, update, add, create and prioritize feature ideas, feedback notes, and roadmaps. **Makers with admin access** can also manage members, integrations, settings, and billing.\n\nEvery Productboard plan also includes unlimited **contributor** and **viewer** roles. **Contributors** can share ideas, requests, and customer feedback and access feature data and roadmaps, but cannot make updates. **Viewers** can only see the Roadmap (and the Portal if shared with them). They cannot add or make updates to Productboard.\n\nHow does onboarding work?\n\nWe designed Productboard\u2019s trial onboarding experience to guide you through the most useful workflows and frequently used roadmaps, boards, and prioritization frameworks.\n\nIn addition, we offer dedicated Success & Support packages that can be added to any plan for customers interested in a more bespoke onboarding experience. [Learn more about our Success & Support offerings here](https://www.productboard.com/productboard-professional-services/).\n\nHow does adding and removing makers work?\n\nIf you are on a yearly plan, your contract includes a fixed minimum of makers. You cannot reduce the number of makers until your contract ends, but you can add new maker seats or upgrade your plan anytime!\n\nIf you are on a monthly plan, you can increase or reduce the number of licenses at any time in Productboard.\n\nWhat support and services are available?\n\nWe offer a variety of free and paid services to support our customers. Learn more [here](https://www.productboard.com/productboard-professional-services/) about our onboarding, success management, support services, and community offerings.\n\nDo you offer discounts for nonprofits?\n\nYes, we provide discounts for charitable nonprofits. For more information, [contact us](https://www.productboard.com/pricing/#form1586).\n\nIs my data secure?\n\nYes, your data is safe with us. The security and privacy of your data is our number one priority. We perform regular security testing, work with third-party security specialists, and host our platform on the highly-secure AWS Amazon cloud. [Learn more](https://www.productboard.com/product/security/).\n\nWhat integrations do you support?\n\nWe integrate with many development tools such as Jira, Azure DevOps, and GitHub, plus customer feedback tools like Slack, Zendesk, and Intercom. [Learn more](https://www.productboard.com/product/integrations/).\n\nHave additional questions?
