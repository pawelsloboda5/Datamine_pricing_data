Live sessions are limited to 60 minutes and 10 live attendees.\n\nWhat is considered a \"live attendee\"?\n\nIt's the number of people who show up live. If you have 60 registered users and 25 show up live during the webinar, then you have 25 live attendees. In that case you should be fine on the Lite plan.\n\nWhat happens when more people attend live than you expected?\n\nYou can have unlimited registrants for your event. You only pay for those who show up live. You\u2019ll be charged .15\u00a2 per extra live attendee after reaching your plan\u2019s attendee limit.

I host a Q&A call for our community each month. We also host our virtual conferences on it. Crowdcast is a HUGE time saver. I never build landing pages for events anymore. I never have to upload recordings and send out links anymore. I love the fact that I can always say, \"Yes, the event will be recorded. Just return to the exact same URL and it'll be waiting for you.\"\u00a0The other benefit is that my audience loves interacting with me on Crowdcast--so there's a relationship-building aspect too.\u00a0The quality of experience that you can create with Crowdcast is something I find\u00a0really\u00a0hard to duplicate elsewhere.\n\n![Image 4: Tara McMullin's testimonial profile photo](https://www.crowdcast.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F043asqj4%2Fproduction%2Fc1f8434d93a8b9e205c62f4100320de08414b9a2-3000x3000.png&w=256&q=75)\n\nTara McMullin\n\nFounder of What Works\n\nWe tried everything. With free platforms, you're beholden to their standards and practices so if you get kicked off the site you no longer have a show. Crowdcast is easy, interactive, and dependable. Plus, Crowdcast gives us a higher quality relationship with our audience, compared to YouTube or Facebook. With other services we would immediately get harassed by trolls who could access our shows. We don't have to worry about that anymore. And we love that our audience can listen on the mobile app during their commute.\n\n![Image 5: Rod Morrow's testimonial profile photo](https://www.crowdcast.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F043asqj4%2Fproduction%2F93903e9bec25ba8358d525bbf681c3d0d8c5f412-2860x3000.png&w=256&q=75)\n\nRod Morrow\n\nThe Black Guy Who Tips\n\nSee what others are saying\n\nMade with \ud83d\udc97 in GermanyIndonesia\n\nFollow us on [X](https://x.com/CrowdcastHQ), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/crowdcast.io/?hl=en), & [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/crowdcast-io)\n\nPRODUCT\n\n[Features](https://www.crowdcast.io/product)[Customers](https://www.crowdcast.io/customers)[Discover](https://www.crowdcast.io/discover)[Pricing](https://www.crowdcast.io/pricing)[Hire an expert](https://dub.sh/crowdcast-experts)\n\nLEARN\n\n[Blog](https://crowdcast.io/blog)[Office Hours](https://www.crowdcast.io/@crowdcast)[Support](http://docs.crowdcast.io/)[What's new](https://www.crowdcast.io/updates)\n\nCOMPANY\n\n[About](https://www.crowdcast.io/about)[Careers](https://dub.sh/join-crowdcast)[Partners](https://www.crowdcast.io/partners)\n\n* * *\n\n[Terms of Service](https://www.crowdcast.io/terms-of-service)\u00b7\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.crowdcast.io/privacy-policy)\u00b7\n\n[Community Guidelines](https://www.crowdcast.io/community-guidelines)\u00b7\n\n[System Status](https://status.crowdcast.io/)\n\nWhere the world gathers \u2014 Reach, engage, and grow your community with online events.",
