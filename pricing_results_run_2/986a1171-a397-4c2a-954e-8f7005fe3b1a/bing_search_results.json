Add-ons such as the Private Labeled App, support options, or deployment options are charged separately.  \n  \nWe accept payments from most major credit cards. In addition, we can issue invoices payable by bank transfer for Business Pro and Enterprise plans.\n\n##### What is a private labeled app?\n\n![Image 28](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/612ecbcc615e87b0b9b38524/671aba364291fdff84775860_angle-down-sharp-light%201.svg)\n\nMoxo offers the ability to private label the mobile app for your business. A small, gray \"Powered by Moxo\" logo will be visible on some app screens. Private labeled apps are launched as unlisted apps on the Apple App store and as a regular apps on the Google Play store. Unlisted apps on the Apple App store are not publicly searchable/discoverable but can still be downloaded from the App Store via a link. When you invite users, your unlisted app link will be included.\n\n##### What happens when I change plans?\n\n![Image 29](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/612ecbcc615e87b0b9b38524/671aba364291fdff84775860_angle-down-sharp-light%201.svg)\n\nUpgrading your plan: Your account will be upgraded and charged immediately.
