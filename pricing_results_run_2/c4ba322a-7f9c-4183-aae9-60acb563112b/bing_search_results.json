And since we\u2019ve been frugal, we\u2019ve been able to make Ryver\u00a0both high quality _and_ affordable.\n\n**How long will my free trial last?**\n\nYour free trial will last 14 days.\n\n**How do I upgrade my Ryver?**\n\nYour Organization admin user can upgrade by clicking the \u201cUpgrade!\u201d button on the user menu inside Ryver.\n\n**When will we be charged?**\n\nWe don\u2019t ask for your credit card upfront, so you\u2019ll only need to pay when your 14-day trial expires.\n\n**Have you got a detailed list of features I could review?**\n\n[We sure do](https://ryver.com/features/).\n\n**Where can I email you if I have more questions?**\n\n[Right here](mailto:sales@ryver.com).\n\n[![Image
