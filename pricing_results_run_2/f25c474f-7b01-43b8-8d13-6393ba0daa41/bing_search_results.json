You can view graphical summaries of visitor & registration data, webinar activity and demographic information.    \n \nWhat kind of engagement metrics are tracked by the analytics feature? \n \nOur analytics feature tracks metrics such as attendee attention rates, poll participation, chat interactions, questions asked, CTA statistics etc.   \n \nCan I see individual registrant behavior in the analytics section?  \n \nYes, the analytics feature provides detailed reports on individual registrant behavior, including the sessions they attended, their country of origin, time spent in the webinar, and the percentage of the replay watched.    \n \nCan I export analytics data for further analysis? \n \nYes, by logging into your EasyWebinar dashboard and navigating to the \u2018People\u2019 section, you can access a comprehensive view of your attendee list across all webinars. This section allows you to filter data by parameters such as webinar, UTM parameters, CTAs, and attendance rates, and you can export the results to CSV or Excel files.         \n \n chevron_left Email Segmentation \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat types of email segmentation does EasyWebinar support?  \n \nEasyWebinar offers pre-built templates for various email types, including welcome emails, pre-webinar reminders, post-webinar follow-ups, and power follow-ups designed for non-buyers.    \n \nAre the email templates customizable? \n \nYes, the emails are completely customizable. You can edit subject lines and email body content, include calendar and sharing options, and modify the call-to-action.    \n \nCan I change the appearance of these pre-built emails?  \n \nYes, you have the option to incorporate custom HTML to further customize the appearance of your emails.   \n \nCan I edit the timing to trigger these emails?  \n \nFor pre-webinar reminders, you can trigger multiple emails up to 5 days before the event. Same for post-webinar follow-ups.    \n \nWhat audience categories can I target with follow-up emails?  \n \nWe cover all audience categories, including those who missed the webinar, attendees who joined but left early, those who saw the offer but didn\u2019t click, and those who clicked the offer. You can tailor your emails to each of these groups.         \n \n chevron_left Live, Simulive & Evergreen Webinars \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat is the difference between simulive & evergreen webinars?  \n \nThough simulive webinars can operate 24/7, they are typically better suited for local audiences based on your time zone. Evergreen webinars, on the other hand, are ideal for a global audience, as they do not require time zone adjustments for attendees. While both formats offer significant reach, evergreen webinars are preferable for businesses targeting global audiences, as they enhance visibility and accessibility.    \n \nWhat options are available for uploading pre-recorded videos for simulive webinars?  \n \nYou can upload pre-recorded videos to video hosting platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, or Wistia and then use them on our platform. Additionally, you can repurpose previously recorded live webinars directly within our platform.    \n \nIs it possible to include simulated chats in automated webinars?  \n \nFor live webinars, you have the option to enable or disable live chat and can also set it to private. Recently, we have introduced a live chat feature for simulive webinars. For evergreen webinars, you can upload simulated chat scripts, allowing attendees to experience interactive engagement even in your absence.    \n \nWhat scheduling options are available for webinars?  \n \nYou can select multiple dates and time slots for your webinars. The Just-In-Time feature allows scheduling at 15, 30, 45 minutes, or 1-hour intervals. Additionally, you can enable instant replay so attendees can watch previously recorded webinars immediately. You can also exclude specific days and time slots from your webinar schedule on EasyWebinar.    \n \nIs it possible to customize the replay video? \n \nYou can create your replay video as an exact replica of your webinar or customize it by offering different CTAs, videos, etc.    \n \nCan I integrate my webinars with CRMs for effective lead management? \n \nYes, EasyWebinar offers integrations with 15+ CRMs, including HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit, and Mailchimp, among others. For additional CRMs, we provide indirect integration through Zapier.         \n \n chevron_left Page Builder \n \n \n \n \n \nIs EasyWebinar\u2019s page builder tool easy to use for someone with no design experience?  \n \nAbsolutely. Our page builder is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing even those with minimal design experience to create professional-looking pages.    \n \nCan I customize the layout and design of my webinar pages?  \n \nYes, you can fully customize the layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements of your webinar pages to align with your brand. Additionally, you can add custom elements such as images, videos, call-to-action buttons, etc. to your webinar pages using the page builder.    \n \nCan I use pre-designed templates with the page builder?  \n \nYes, EasyWebinar offers a range of aesthetically designed templates of different themes that you can use and customize to fit your branding and webinar needs.    \n \nDoes the page builder support mobile-responsive designs?  \n \nYes, the page builder ensures that your webinar pages are mobile-responsive and look great on all devices.    \n \nIs it possible to preview my webinar pages before publishing?  \n \nYes, you can preview your pages in real-time to ensure they look and function as expected. You can then click 'Save' and 'Publish' when you are ready to make them live.         \n \n chevron_left Done-For-You service \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat does the Done-for-You service include?  \n \nOur Done-for-You service provides a comprehensive solution where our team handles the webinar setup, marketing strategy, email funnel set-up and periodic optimization of your webinars, from initial design to final execution. This end-to-end solution saves you significant time and effort by allowing experts to manage the technical aspects of your webinars, ensuring a professional setup and smooth execution.    \n \nCan I integrate my existing branding and design into the Done-for-You service?  \n \nAbsolutely. We work with your existing branding and design elements to ensure that your webinars align with your brand\u2019s identity and messaging.    \n \nHow long does it take to set up a webinar using the Done-for-You service?  \n \nThe setup time can vary depending on the complexity of your webinar and specific requirements, but typically, we aim to complete the setup within 3 days to a couple of weeks.    \n \nHow do I get started with the Done-for-You service?  \n \nTo get started, you can book a call with one of our product experts. We will guide you through the process and provide a tailored plan for your webinar.    \n \nAre there any additional costs associated with the Done-for-You service?  \n \nThe cost of the Done-for-You service varies depending on your specific needs and the complexity of your webinar. We provide a detailed quote based on your requirements.         \n \n chevron_left Pricing & Subscription \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat do the terms \u2018lead\u2019 and \u2018active webinar\u2019 mean?  \n \n\u2018Leads\u2019 are individuals who have registered for your webinar. An \u2018active webinar\u2019 is a published webinar while drafts of webinars do not count against your subscription. A single active webinar can have many attendees across many recurring sessions but it is still considered as just 1 active webinar.    \n \nHow can I contact support?  \n \nOur support team is available 7 days a week to assist you. You can reach us via email at support@easywebinar.com or send a message through the chat icon on your dashboard.    \n \nCan I cancel my subscription any time?  \n \nAbsolutely!

Test out our app, see if it floats your boat, and then make your decision. No strings attached!    \n \nWhat are the pricing options available for EasyWebinar?  \n \nWe offer three subscription tiers: Standard, Pro, and Enterprise plans, with substantial discounts available for annual subscriptions. You can easily upgrade or change your plan through the Subscriptions section in your EasyWebinar profile or by contacting our support team. For detailed pricing and features, please visit our pricing page.    \n \nHow can I increase the number of leads/registrations per month?  \n \nYou can contact our support team or purchase subscription add-ons through the Subscriptions section in your EasyWebinar dashboard.
