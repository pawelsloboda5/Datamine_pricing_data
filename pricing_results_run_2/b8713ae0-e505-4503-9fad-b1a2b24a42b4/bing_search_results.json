We wanted something more modern and smooth. It has all the functionalities we could want, including extras that we haven\u2019t had with other CRMs, like parsing from LinkedIn.\n\nJordan O\u2019Neill (London)Head of Talent Research- Reflection X\n\n![Image 2: Jordan O\u2019Neill (London)](blob:http://localhost/b25cc9c5a99421dcf29d28aaf3aa34b7)\n\nRecruit CRM is the easiest and most customizable ATS/CRM I have ever used. I\u2019ve worked in the recruitment industry for over 20 years and have used more systems than I can remember. On top of an incredible software platform, their customer service is hands down THE best!\n\nPaul Diaz (Washington DC)Founder- Hire Power Consulting\n\n![Image 3: Paul Diaz (Washington DC)](blob:http://localhost/57e5f38e84299a1dafa5be8ebe283bbe)\n\nIf you need anything, the team is available to help in no time at all. This is the most versatile system out there, and I have trialed a lot! It\u2019s intuitive and very user-friendly. They are constantly updating and making the system even better.\n\nPhoebe Chadwick (London)Director- Dot Recruitment\n\n![Image 4: Phoebe Chadwick (London)](blob:http://localhost/ca20701a43e3054720e957a660ec9fcd)\n\nI\u2019ve used Bullhorn, I\u2019ve used Pipedrive, I\u2019ve used Zoho Recruit, and they are all kind of lackluster. They don\u2019t deliver a product that solves our problems and the solutions we need. Recruit CRM is the first product that I\u2019ve seen that\u2019s actually built by recruiters for recruiters. The user interface is very user-friendly since many recruiters aren\u2019t the most tech-savvy people.\n\nBrennen JacksonCVO- MMI Industries\n\n![Image 5: Brennen Jackson](blob:http://localhost/50242111964a34de37d60549999cb0e5)\n\nRated the best recruitment agency software\n------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 6: medal 3](blob:http://localhost/132877bb09272697661085a1a904a386)\n\n![Image 7: get-app](blob:http://localhost/09c127ce5b0a4fc29a9e986c34f5d4b8)\n\n![Image 8: top-rated](blob:http://localhost/a2f3c18daca94b4c0e1e512e6315fec7)\n\n![Image 9: most-recommended](blob:http://localhost/f016fac74bdf7351d3ac232040f6ef95)\n\n![Image 10: Capterra certificate](blob:http://localhost/4bd78d23c2b9686851523ad46d85155b)\n\n![Image 11: best-customer-support](blob:http://localhost/f54984757690857b6e91518f260fcb44)\n\n![Image 12: ease-of-use](blob:http://localhost/35a1b0949ac1ecef58e9aa5edc45b161)\n\n![Image 13: front-runners](blob:http://localhost/e0093736fa0e13d0ddd4e07d7d5b7155)\n\n![Image 14: High Performer](blob:http://localhost/132877bb09272697661085a1a904a386)\n\nHave questions?
