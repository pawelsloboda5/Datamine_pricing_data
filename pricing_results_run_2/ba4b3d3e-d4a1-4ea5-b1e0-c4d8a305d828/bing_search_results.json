Please explore our help center or contact us for more.\n\nAs a Member, can I use the B1G1 branding on my company collateral?\n\n![Image 8](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nYour Membership includes the licensed use of B1G1 Branding. This means that you can display the B1G1 Business for Good logo on your communication resources such as your email signature, business cards and other marketing materials. If you choose to print items on your marketing materials and product packaging, you can always contact our team first to evaluate the messaging before production. This way, we can ensure the resonance and integrity of the messaging and even help you select the ideal projects you can give to depending on your giving budget and length of commitment. Please [contact us](mailto:hello@b1g1.com) for more info if you have specific ideas in mind.\n\nHow do we engage our team members in B1G1?\n\n![Image 9](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nIf you choose to do so, you can easily invite your team members to create their own B1G1 accounts and participate in the impact creation. B1G1 Membership Packages include different numbers of Team Member Accounts based on the company size and you can assign different levels of access to your team (e.g. company giving admin). You can also request to purchase additional Team Accounts if you need more. If you use Team Accounts, you can also purchase Impact Tokens and engage your team in the choice of impacts they want to create - regularly or on special occasions such as their birthdays and anniversaries.\n\nEven if you choose not to use Team Accounts, you can invite your team to take a look at B1G1 Project List and let you know the projects they like to support. This way, everyone can participate in choosing the impact they want to help create in the world. B1G1 helps you tune into many opportunities to create holistic and lasting impacts in the world by harnessing the power of your business.\n\nWhat happens to my B1G1 Membership fee?\n\n![Image 10](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nWhen you join B1G1 you not only add meaning and tangible impact to your business but you become part of something bigger. You are joining a Movement \u2014 a global network of purpose-driven, impact-driven businesses collectively creating a real positive impact in our world.\n\nYour B1G1 membership fee quite literally allows B1G1 to do what it does \u2014 to bring you this \u2018Operating System for Good\u2019. Without your membership fee, there would be no B1G1. It allows us to select and vet high-impact projects for you so that your giving impact really is maximized in every way possible. And it allows us to continually innovate to increase both the depth and scope of your impact and to make using B1G1 ever more exciting and valuable for you and your business.\n\nThis structure allows us to keep your membership and your giving transactions completely and transparently separate. B1G1 does not take any fee from your contribution - all your contributions are passed onto the Worthy Causes excluding credit card and bank fees.\n\nEach membership tier enables every sized company to do their bit, with larger sized companies naturally gaining proportionally more benefits. As a B1G1: Business for Good you\u2019re ensuring that this community of giving businesses can create the biggest impact possible.\n\nHow does B1G1 select projects to list in the portal?\n\n![Image 11](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nThe B1G1 initiative is run by two sister organizations - the social enterprise (B1G1.com) that runs the platform and business program and a 501(c)(3) charity (B1G1 Giving, Inc.) that manages B1G1's Worthy Cause program. The Board of B1G1 Giving sets the criteria of the Worthy Cause program and evaluate all applications coming from charitable organizations that are recommended to B1G1. If the organization is approved, their projects are evaluated, broken down into a micro-impact unit, and listed in the port. All B1G1 projects are also reviewed annually to ensure effective and sustainable outcomes.\n\nBecause of its model, B1G1 can only work with a limited type of charity organizations that can meet all our requirements. The Worthy Cause membership is totally free for the approved organizations, and B1G1 does not take any fee from our Members' contribution - all the contributions are passed onto the projects they choose to support, excluding credit card and bank fees. We can expand our reach to many more causes as more businesses join us. B1G1 Members can recommend their favourite charity organizations to B1G1 too. You can learn more about B1G1's Worthy Cause program here: [b1g1.org](https://b1g1.org/).\n\nIs there a minimum amount to commit to giving?\n\n![Image 12](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nWe\u2019re often asked, \u201chow much should we give?\u201d In B1G1, you\u2019re in total control of your giving budget and mode of giving. This is because we are committed to making it easy for any business of any stage and size to start making a positive impact in the world, without waiting for 'one day'.\n\nWith that in mind though, many B1G1 Members like the guideline (and it is a guideline only) of '1% of revenue' as a good giving benchmark. This is also aligned with the recommendations of other initiatives such as \u2018Pledge 1%\u2019 and \u20181% for the Planet\u2019. B1G1's charity arm, B1G1 Giving is an approved Non-profit Partner of 1% for the Planet initiative, so your giving to all environmental projects can be included in your 1% for the Planet giving should you choose to participate in the 1% pledge too. And you can also allocate some of your giving budget to support your local charity organizations and other efforts to make your giving an even more sustainable and impactful giving business.\n\nAgain, one of the many great things with B1G1 is that you are always in control of how much you give AND how often, so as your business grows, so too can your giving. As your membership fee is separate to your giving amounts, you can easily view, manage and adjust your giving amounts directly within your account.\n\nGetting Started is Simple.\n--------------------------\n\nWhat B1G1 Members Say\n---------------------\n\n\"B1G1 has changed so many lives, including mine.

Please explore our help center or contact us for more.\n\nAs a Member, can I use the B1G1 branding on my company collateral?\n\n![Image 8](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nYour Membership includes the licensed use of B1G1 Branding. This means that you can display the B1G1 Business for Good logo on your communication resources such as your email signature, business cards and other marketing materials. If you choose to print items on your marketing materials and product packaging, you can always contact our team first to evaluate the messaging before production. This way, we can ensure the resonance and integrity of the messaging and even help you select the ideal projects you can give to depending on your giving budget and length of commitment. Please [contact us](mailto:hello@b1g1.com) for more info if you have specific ideas in mind.\n\nHow do we engage our team members in B1G1?\n\n![Image 9](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nIf you choose to do so, you can easily invite your team members to create their own B1G1 accounts and participate in the impact creation. B1G1 Membership Packages include different numbers of Team Member Accounts based on the company size and you can assign different levels of access to your team (e.g. company giving admin). You can also request to purchase additional Team Accounts if you need more. If you use Team Accounts, you can also purchase Impact Tokens and engage your team in the choice of impacts they want to create - regularly or on special occasions such as their birthdays and anniversaries.\n\nEven if you choose not to use Team Accounts, you can invite your team to take a look at B1G1 Project List and let you know the projects they like to support. This way, everyone can participate in choosing the impact they want to help create in the world. B1G1 helps you tune into many opportunities to create holistic and lasting impacts in the world by harnessing the power of your business.\n\nWhat happens to my B1G1 Membership fee?\n\n![Image 10](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nWhen you join B1G1 you not only add meaning and tangible impact to your business but you become part of something bigger. You are joining a Movement \u2014 a global network of purpose-driven, impact-driven businesses collectively creating a real positive impact in our world.\n\nYour B1G1 membership fee quite literally allows B1G1 to do what it does \u2014 to bring you this \u2018Operating System for Good\u2019. Without your membership fee, there would be no B1G1. It allows us to select and vet high-impact projects for you so that your giving impact really is maximized in every way possible. And it allows us to continually innovate to increase both the depth and scope of your impact and to make using B1G1 ever more exciting and valuable for you and your business.\n\nThis structure allows us to keep your membership and your giving transactions completely and transparently separate. B1G1 does not take any fee from your contribution - all your contributions are passed onto the Worthy Causes excluding credit card and bank fees.\n\nEach membership tier enables every sized company to do their bit, with larger sized companies naturally gaining proportionally more benefits. As a B1G1: Business for Good you\u2019re ensuring that this community of giving businesses can create the biggest impact possible.\n\nHow does B1G1 select projects to list in the portal?\n\n![Image 11](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nThe B1G1 initiative is run by two sister organizations - the social enterprise (B1G1.com) that runs the platform and business program and a 501(c)(3) charity (B1G1 Giving, Inc.) that manages B1G1's Worthy Cause program. The Board of B1G1 Giving sets the criteria of the Worthy Cause program and evaluate all applications coming from charitable organizations that are recommended to B1G1. If the organization is approved, their projects are evaluated, broken down into a micro-impact unit, and listed in the port. All B1G1 projects are also reviewed annually to ensure effective and sustainable outcomes.\n\nBecause of its model, B1G1 can only work with a limited type of charity organizations that can meet all our requirements. The Worthy Cause membership is totally free for the approved organizations, and B1G1 does not take any fee from our Members' contribution - all the contributions are passed onto the projects they choose to support, excluding credit card and bank fees. We can expand our reach to many more causes as more businesses join us. B1G1 Members can recommend their favourite charity organizations to B1G1 too. You can learn more about B1G1's Worthy Cause program here: [b1g1.org](https://b1g1.org/).\n\nIs there a minimum amount to commit to giving?\n\n![Image 12](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea2401a42802b3f77528f50/63ebf368bdf68227efea7b5d_chevron-black.svg)\n\nWe\u2019re often asked, \u201chow much should we give?\u201d In B1G1, you\u2019re in total control of your giving budget and mode of giving. This is because we are committed to making it easy for any business of any stage and size to start making a positive impact in the world, without waiting for 'one day'.\n\nWith that in mind though, many B1G1 Members like the guideline (and it is a guideline only) of '1% of revenue' as a good giving benchmark. This is also aligned with the recommendations of other initiatives such as \u2018Pledge 1%\u2019 and \u20181% for the Planet\u2019. B1G1's charity arm, B1G1 Giving is an approved Non-profit Partner of 1% for the Planet initiative, so your giving to all environmental projects can be included in your 1% for the Planet giving should you choose to participate in the 1% pledge too. And you can also allocate some of your giving budget to support your local charity organizations and other efforts to make your giving an even more sustainable and impactful giving business.\n\nAgain, one of the many great things with B1G1 is that you are always in control of how much you give AND how often, so as your business grows, so too can your giving. As your membership fee is separate to your giving amounts, you can easily view, manage and adjust your giving amounts directly within your account.\n\nGetting Started is Simple.\n--------------------------\n\nWhat B1G1 Members Say\n---------------------\n\n\"B1G1 has changed so many lives, including mine.
