Choose the add-on you like, click on the corresponding Subscribe button and follow the instructions. For more details, please refer to the article.\nHow long is the Trial and how it works?\nAll add-on services have a 14-day free trial period. Starting a trial period does not require a card. Once you\u2019ve started the trial period, the Billing & Subscriptions page will display the trial expiration date. If you want to continue using the service after finishing the trial, activate the subscription by clicking on the \u2018Activate\u2019 button.\n\nAt any time, you can cancel the trial with the \u2018Unsubscribe\u2019 button. For more details, please refer to the article. The free trial will last for 14 days and cannot be canceled even if the user unsubscribes from an add-on. If the user resubscribes again after 14 days of the free trial period, the user will not be eligible for free trial anymore.\nHow do I activate the subscription?\nUpon starting a trial, you can either activate the subscription immediately or after the end of the trial period. During the subscription activation, you will be asked to provide your payment card details.\n\nPlease note that the price shown for the Employee Management is per store, and for Advanced Inventory is per store. If you have added a number of employees or stores only for testing during the free trial, and you do not wish to pay for all of them, please adjust the numbers of employees or stores according to your needs before activating the subscription.\n\nIf you activate the subscription before the end of the free trial, you will still be able to use the service without paying till the end of the trial period. Your card will be charged and an invoice will be issued at the end of the trial.\nWhat form of payment is accepted?\nWe accept credit and debit cards. Currently, we only accept Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, Discover, and JCB cards. Users from the USA, Canada, and Japan can use American Express (Amex) card type as well.\nWhy is my card declined?\nThe decline indicates that the card-issuing bank could not process the transaction. Please contact your bank. The most common reasons for a card to be declined could be that the transaction exceeded the credit limit, declined based on the location, the bank's fraud rules blocked the transaction and so on. Please check with your bank for more details.\n\nWhen contacting the bank, we would recommend you to reach the second-tier customer service of your bank. The first-tier customer service may not have the access and system visibility required to locate any factors behind the decline. We recommend you to prepare some detailed information related to the transaction upon calling the bank (e.g. the amount of the transaction, the website the transaction was made at and the time of the transaction).\nWill I lose my sales data while my account is blocked?\nIf for some reason, the payment fails and the back office gets blocked, your sales data or the Advanced Inventory documents will not be lost. Furthermore, the tracking of stock will continue to operate. Once you\u2019ve paid up and your account is unblocked, all the sales and the stock levels in the back office will show the most updated information.\nHow can I cancel my subscription?\nFor your convenience, your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of the billing period. You can easily cancel your subscription at any time.\nFollow these easy steps to cancel a subscription:\n1. Login to the Back office with the account owner email and password.\n2. Go to Settings and then to Billing & Subscriptions section.\n3. Click the Unsubscribe button to cancel an active subscription.\n\nAny remaining balance will be converted to a credit, which can be used to pay for future subscriptions.\nIf I stop using Loyverse POS or any paid services, would my card get charged?\nWhile you are subscribed to any subscription, your card will continue to be charged until you unsubscribe, even if you do not use any add-on or Loyverse POS App.\n\nIf you decide not to use the Loyverse POS, please unsubscribe from the subscriptions in your Back Office. We do not refund the charged amount if the subscription is active.\nCan I stop recurring payments or delete my card details?\nTo stop recurring payments or delete your card details, please email to help@loyverse.com from your business account email, stating your request.\nHow can I pause my subscription for some period?\nIf, for some reason, you want to suspend your activity for a certain period and do not use the Add-ons, but you plan to return to them later, we can pause your subscriptions. While the subscription is paused, it won\u2019t be renewed automatically. Your back office will be blocked, but all data will be saved and available after reactivating the subscription.\n\nWhen you restart to run your business, you can resume your subscription by pressing the Reactivate button on the billing page. When you reactivate the payment, you will begin a new subscription period, and a new invoice will be issued. If you had an unpaid invoice before the subscription was paused, you would also need to pay it at the time of subscription reactivation. Please contact the support team with a request to pause your subscriptions.\n\u00a0\n\nIf you have any further questions on any issues regarding Subscriptions and Billing, please contact the support team\n\nEmpower your business with Loyverse POS\nGET STARTED FREE\nBusiness types\nGrocery & convenience\nCaf\u00e9\nRestaurant\nRetail\nBar & Pub\nClothing & accessories\nSmall Business\nSmall Business POS\nPOS System\nLoyalty Program\nAccept Credit Cards\nSmartpay\nSumUp\nTyro\nZettle\nYoco\nLoyverse API\nPoint of Sale\nLoyverse POS\nBack Office\nPOS Dashboard\nKitchen Display\nCustomer Display\nEmployee Management\nMulti-store Management\nInventory Management\nLoyverse POS\nAbout\nCommunity\nBlog\nMedia kit\nApp marketplace\nAPI documentation\nStatus\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nData Processing Addendum\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nAPI Terms of Use\nTerms of Third-Party Integration\n\n\u00a9 2025 Loyverse\nFive Galaxies Commerce Ltd\nThird Floor, 20 Old Bailey\nLondon, England EC4M 7AN, United Kingdom\n\nThe basic features of Loyverse POS are free to use, and the add-ons are available for a reasonable fee",
