We split tested 595,000 sessions with Vimeo, YouTube and Wistia, and they couldn\u2019t beat Vidalytics \ud83d\ude42\"\n\n\"Optimizing VSLs is fucking hard. Vidalytics allows you to track engagement of your videos by UTM parameters! I found this feature and saw more than a 5X engagement boost with the same video, just a different ad angle (3.6% vs. 17.34%). This is a game changer. It allows us to optimize our funnel so much more effectively now that we can see exactly which ad angles are driving the highest intent. **This is pretty sweet!\"**\n\n\"You should definitely use Vidalytics for video hosting. When I switched over, their Smart Autoplay increased my conversions by 30%. This is why I use Vidalytics for all of my Video Sales Letters\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a video hosting service called Vidalytics. That thing\u2019s really cool! When a viewer hits X minutes \\[watch time in your video\\], it\u2019ll tag them in Vidalytics, and then you can use Zapier to send that tag data over to your email system, or CRM.\u201d\n\n\"Been in the space 12 years, my videos have generated over $700M. Every time somebody asks me, \u201cHey\u2026 video hosting, who do you recommend?\u201d Vidalytics is always number one. There\u2019s no one else, doesn\u2019t matter. Just make the investment, you deserve it, your business deserves it.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics has been our go-to for video hosting. I've been an entrepreneur my entire life, with an MBA and ten years in digital marketing. We've been with Vidalytics for four years, and they\u2019ve been awesome. The tech is solid, hosting is reliable, and the videos load fast.\n\nThe reporting and data tools are exactly what we need in direct response. Their support is great, especially with interactive videos, which we've been using for three years. Vidalytics is always on top of the latest tech and actually implements feedback. We\u2019ve tried other platforms, but Vidalytics has been by far the best.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics\u2019 Smart Autoplay bumped my conversion rate by 49%. I\u2019m never leaving Vidalytics!\"\n\n\"I love Vidalytics. Better pricing than Wistia, with WAY better analytics. The autoplay that restarts when unmuted pays for itself in increased conversions each month for us. Best video hosting for our industry, hands down!'\n\n\u201cOver the last 20 years, I\u2019ve used ALL of the other video platforms \u2014 JW Player, Flowplayer, Vimeo, Wistia, Youtube and nothing compares to the power and insights that Vidalytics gives you. It is hands down the best.\u201d\n\n\"I love that Vidalytics was built by marketers for marketers... Our conversions are up because of smart-autoplay, faster load times, start-from-where-you-left-off for returning visitors etc... Plus they moved all of our videos over from our backup, which was great. More conversions, lower costs, great customer service.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics gives you deeper analytics around engagement and where viewers convert. This is super useful if you're like me and want to split test everything. Other video solutions don't give the insights needed to optimize for conversion. The biggest difference was the Smart Autoplay. Vidalytics stands out with its comprehensive analytics and conversion-boosting features, making it an indispensable tool for anyone serious about video marketing.\"\n\n\u201cVidalytics seems like a great program so far. I have already recommended it to a few people I know that were using Vimeo and had issues like I did.\u201d\n\n\"They have the best analytics for marketing videos -- period. And a ton of unique features like Smart Autoplay and Countdown timers.They also have features that save someone from bouncing while watching your video, since it works when the video is paused. They're all called 'Exit' features. Like Exit Call to Actions, Exit Play Gates, and Exit Thumbnails. It's awesome.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics provides so much value at the magical intersection of engagement, conversion, and insight. It's an essential tool in the stack for digital marketers and online course creators.\"\n\n\"One vote here for Vidalytics, their unmuted autoplays increased video plays with the flashing message on top of video while it's playing in the background, then restarts from the beginning when clicked. Genius.\"\n\n\"I produce a TON of video sales letters. Vidalytics is a perfect fit for these businesses using VSLs. So I recommend it to all my clients. Vidalytics just makes sense for any direct response company instead of Wistia or Vimeo.\"\n\n\"Resume Play is the reason we migrated to Vidalytics. We're grateful that \\[videos\\] can be set to autoplay, muted with a quick, clear, and easy \"click for audio\" option. The \\[fact\\] that Vidalytics then restarts the video from the beginning is heavenly.\"\n\n\"I split tested Vidalytics against Wistia and it destroyed them. Vidalytics works so well I almost didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about it because it is such a competitive advantage.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ve been using Vidalytics for a while and absolutely love it. Its mobile features alone are worth switching. Not to mention it converts better than other players, its analytics are on-point and it\u2019s the fastest video player I\u2019ve tested. I highly recommend them for your marketing videos.\"\n\n\"I love how it shows me not just video analytics, but also where people converted in the video. Only video player I've found that really gives me the data I need to optimize for sales. I'm able to see what parts of the video is performing best, where I'm losing people and at what point they are converting.\"\n\n\"I'm transitioning to Vidalytics from Vidyard. Seriously, I've been totally blown away by your product so far, especially considering the price.\"\n\nTodd Brown recommended your software in the E5 camp. It's great!\n\nThe first version of my VSL hosted on Vidalytics did \u00a370,000. I'm relaunching v2 now.\n\n\"In the few months since we signed up Vidalytics has been AMAZING. It\u2019s a real game changer. I\u2019ve already edited our webinar replay to reflect the poor drop off at the beginning. I\u2019m not sure how anyone with marketing videos can get by without Vidalytics, it's really that good.\"\n\nWe love Vidalytics - the more you measure, the better. It also allows for custom messages with mobile autoplay, AND\u00a0faster load speeds.\n\n\"I can NOT afford to have the videos in my funnel be \u201cblack holes\u201d where I don\u2019t know what is happening. Before, it was just a guessing game. Now with Vidalytics, I know exactly where and how my videos are converting. Making it easy to improve their conversions.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics is my secret weapon for troubleshooting VSLs so that I can increase conversions. It\u2019s turned what I thought were duds into high converting videos.\"\n\n\"When you've had a great customer satisfaction experience - you're in. You're part of the family. Support did that. It was a very cool exchange, answered my questions, was super cool about it. You are being well represented here. And as my teacher Ben Settle says, nothing like customer service to create a referral client.\"\n\n\"We are charged in dollars, but earn in Brazilian Reais. The currency affects us a lot. Trust me, I didn't want to pay for Vidalytics. But I just have to. Because it simply works. I've tested it against every other video platform out there, and it's just simply better. We make more money with Vidalytics. Period. That's why we use it in all of our companies.\"\n\n\"I love Vidalytics because of the countless options I can control such as AutoPlay, Countdown Timers, Resume Play and many more. The analytics on the videos are detailed and help my team and I make the right decisions to increase conversions.\"\n\n\"WOW!! Overlaying the conversion on the same graph is the missing piece, that is awesome.\"\n\n\"I absolutely love Vidalytics because I can scale with it. We are a high volume business. We drive a lot of traffic from Facebook and YouTube and we are just getting started. Love the resume play and the delayed CTA button tied to the player position.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics is JUST what I've been looking for in a long long time!!! I'm so excited. Gonna launch a new product next month. Can't wait to see how it converts.\"\n\n\"Great and friendly service. Awesome tools in Vidalytics! Compliments for the way it's designed!\"\n\nCancel anytime \u2014 either from your account page or by contacting us, and we\u2019ll still be friends.\n\nOh yeah! Anytime you like \u2014 you got it. You can do this from your account page.\n\nThe easiest thing to do is take your _average video size \u00d7 your number of videos \u00d7 number of plays._ Make sure it is in GB and BAM! That is your bandwidth. We know this is kind of ghetto, so until our team builds our bandwidth calculator, feel free to start a chat with us :) However, you should be happily surprised that you use a lot less bandwidth with Vidalytics, because we use true adaptive bitrate streaming. Other platforms claim they use adaptive bitrate streaming, but really only do on a small portion of their video streaming. Which is dumb. We\u2019re not dumb. We use it 100% of the time. This optimizes the size of your videos for each user, so they get the perfect size based on their internet connection speed. This means your videos are always super fast and play seamlessly for your users with nearly no buffering ever. And you\u2019ll save big on your bandwidth bill.\n\nYou can store as many videos as you want if you're on a paid plan. They will cost a small charge of 25\u00a2 per video. This is all automatic. Just add \u2018em and we\u2019ll handle it. Our Free plan comes with space for 3 videos. If you need more space, you can upgrade anytime ;)\n\nYES! Other analytics tools, like Google Analytics, are super confusing and overly-complex, because they were built by a committee of technical people who tried to solve everyone\u2019s wants, dreams and desires. Vidalytics\u00ae is built for one person \u2014 the **marketer.**Whether you\u2019re doing branding, lead gen, straight sale, product explainer videos, training videos or even product content \u2014 we built Vidalytics for you. Because, when you\u2019re a marketer, you care about very specific metrics. Not a billion, not even a 100. We put the dozen plus metrics that you need to make decisions about your marketing videos right at your fingertips. And our UI is super sexy, incredibly intuitive and easy to use. Plus, we hold regular training webinars on using our software, so you get the most out of it and the latest tactics in video conversions.\n\nYep! You can change anything on the player \u2014 the colors of the foreground or background, remove or show any of the buttons. You can even enable auto-play, or disable pausing and seeking on your videos.\n\nYes! Vidalytics\u2019 player is a lean HTML5 responsive player ready for any sized screen.\n\nYes! Vidalytics transcodes your videos into several different sizes and formats so they can play on any device anywhere in the world.\n\nOh yeah! This is where we chop up your video into hundreds of little pieces and feed a few chunks to your user at a time. This 1) Saves you a ton on bandwidth. And 2) allows us to switch the size and quality midstream if your user\u2019s connection slows down. So your users almost never see a buffering video of yours. Because when videos buffer, we all suffer.\n\nBecause we care deeply about uptime. Nothing is more annoying than having traffic to your videos that don\u2019t play. This is a common occurrence on even large video networks, but we\u2019re dedicated to you \u2014 the marketer. We have 3 CDNs which are constantly being optimized for speed. We will always serve your video from the fastest one, even if it is a matter of milliseconds. Why? Because speed matters for conversions. Period.\n\nIf you\u2019re running a lot of volume (1 TB+), then we can definitely hook you up. [Contact us here](https://vidalytics.com/contact) and we\u2019ll customize the perfect plan for you.\n\n### Concierge Onboarding: Let Us Move Your Videos For You \u2014 For Free!\n\nWhether you have a thousand videos or just a few, our team is here to help!

We split tested 595,000 sessions with Vimeo, YouTube and Wistia, and they couldn\u2019t beat Vidalytics \ud83d\ude42\"\n\n\"Optimizing VSLs is fucking hard. Vidalytics allows you to track engagement of your videos by UTM parameters! I found this feature and saw more than a 5X engagement boost with the same video, just a different ad angle (3.6% vs. 17.34%). This is a game changer. It allows us to optimize our funnel so much more effectively now that we can see exactly which ad angles are driving the highest intent. **This is pretty sweet!\"**\n\n\"You should definitely use Vidalytics for video hosting. When I switched over, their Smart Autoplay increased my conversions by 30%. This is why I use Vidalytics for all of my Video Sales Letters\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a video hosting service called Vidalytics. That thing\u2019s really cool! When a viewer hits X minutes \\[watch time in your video\\], it\u2019ll tag them in Vidalytics, and then you can use Zapier to send that tag data over to your email system, or CRM.\u201d\n\n\"Been in the space 12 years, my videos have generated over $700M. Every time somebody asks me, \u201cHey\u2026 video hosting, who do you recommend?\u201d Vidalytics is always number one. There\u2019s no one else, doesn\u2019t matter. Just make the investment, you deserve it, your business deserves it.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics has been our go-to for video hosting. I've been an entrepreneur my entire life, with an MBA and ten years in digital marketing. We've been with Vidalytics for four years, and they\u2019ve been awesome. The tech is solid, hosting is reliable, and the videos load fast.\n\nThe reporting and data tools are exactly what we need in direct response. Their support is great, especially with interactive videos, which we've been using for three years. Vidalytics is always on top of the latest tech and actually implements feedback. We\u2019ve tried other platforms, but Vidalytics has been by far the best.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics\u2019 Smart Autoplay bumped my conversion rate by 49%. I\u2019m never leaving Vidalytics!\"\n\n\"I love Vidalytics. Better pricing than Wistia, with WAY better analytics. The autoplay that restarts when unmuted pays for itself in increased conversions each month for us. Best video hosting for our industry, hands down!'\n\n\u201cOver the last 20 years, I\u2019ve used ALL of the other video platforms \u2014 JW Player, Flowplayer, Vimeo, Wistia, Youtube and nothing compares to the power and insights that Vidalytics gives you. It is hands down the best.\u201d\n\n\"I love that Vidalytics was built by marketers for marketers... Our conversions are up because of smart-autoplay, faster load times, start-from-where-you-left-off for returning visitors etc... Plus they moved all of our videos over from our backup, which was great. More conversions, lower costs, great customer service.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics gives you deeper analytics around engagement and where viewers convert. This is super useful if you're like me and want to split test everything. Other video solutions don't give the insights needed to optimize for conversion. The biggest difference was the Smart Autoplay. Vidalytics stands out with its comprehensive analytics and conversion-boosting features, making it an indispensable tool for anyone serious about video marketing.\"\n\n\u201cVidalytics seems like a great program so far. I have already recommended it to a few people I know that were using Vimeo and had issues like I did.\u201d\n\n\"They have the best analytics for marketing videos -- period. And a ton of unique features like Smart Autoplay and Countdown timers.They also have features that save someone from bouncing while watching your video, since it works when the video is paused. They're all called 'Exit' features. Like Exit Call to Actions, Exit Play Gates, and Exit Thumbnails. It's awesome.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics provides so much value at the magical intersection of engagement, conversion, and insight. It's an essential tool in the stack for digital marketers and online course creators.\"\n\n\"One vote here for Vidalytics, their unmuted autoplays increased video plays with the flashing message on top of video while it's playing in the background, then restarts from the beginning when clicked. Genius.\"\n\n\"I produce a TON of video sales letters. Vidalytics is a perfect fit for these businesses using VSLs. So I recommend it to all my clients. Vidalytics just makes sense for any direct response company instead of Wistia or Vimeo.\"\n\n\"Resume Play is the reason we migrated to Vidalytics. We're grateful that \\[videos\\] can be set to autoplay, muted with a quick, clear, and easy \"click for audio\" option. The \\[fact\\] that Vidalytics then restarts the video from the beginning is heavenly.\"\n\n\"I split tested Vidalytics against Wistia and it destroyed them. Vidalytics works so well I almost didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about it because it is such a competitive advantage.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ve been using Vidalytics for a while and absolutely love it. Its mobile features alone are worth switching. Not to mention it converts better than other players, its analytics are on-point and it\u2019s the fastest video player I\u2019ve tested. I highly recommend them for your marketing videos.\"\n\n\"I love how it shows me not just video analytics, but also where people converted in the video. Only video player I've found that really gives me the data I need to optimize for sales. I'm able to see what parts of the video is performing best, where I'm losing people and at what point they are converting.\"\n\n\"I'm transitioning to Vidalytics from Vidyard. Seriously, I've been totally blown away by your product so far, especially considering the price.\"\n\nTodd Brown recommended your software in the E5 camp. It's great!\n\nThe first version of my VSL hosted on Vidalytics did \u00a370,000. I'm relaunching v2 now.\n\n\"In the few months since we signed up Vidalytics has been AMAZING. It\u2019s a real game changer. I\u2019ve already edited our webinar replay to reflect the poor drop off at the beginning. I\u2019m not sure how anyone with marketing videos can get by without Vidalytics, it's really that good.\"\n\nWe love Vidalytics - the more you measure, the better. It also allows for custom messages with mobile autoplay, AND\u00a0faster load speeds.\n\n\"I can NOT afford to have the videos in my funnel be \u201cblack holes\u201d where I don\u2019t know what is happening. Before, it was just a guessing game. Now with Vidalytics, I know exactly where and how my videos are converting. Making it easy to improve their conversions.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics is my secret weapon for troubleshooting VSLs so that I can increase conversions. It\u2019s turned what I thought were duds into high converting videos.\"\n\n\"When you've had a great customer satisfaction experience - you're in. You're part of the family. Support did that. It was a very cool exchange, answered my questions, was super cool about it. You are being well represented here. And as my teacher Ben Settle says, nothing like customer service to create a referral client.\"\n\n\"We are charged in dollars, but earn in Brazilian Reais. The currency affects us a lot. Trust me, I didn't want to pay for Vidalytics. But I just have to. Because it simply works. I've tested it against every other video platform out there, and it's just simply better. We make more money with Vidalytics. Period. That's why we use it in all of our companies.\"\n\n\"I love Vidalytics because of the countless options I can control such as AutoPlay, Countdown Timers, Resume Play and many more. The analytics on the videos are detailed and help my team and I make the right decisions to increase conversions.\"\n\n\"WOW!! Overlaying the conversion on the same graph is the missing piece, that is awesome.\"\n\n\"I absolutely love Vidalytics because I can scale with it. We are a high volume business. We drive a lot of traffic from Facebook and YouTube and we are just getting started. Love the resume play and the delayed CTA button tied to the player position.\"\n\n\"Vidalytics is JUST what I've been looking for in a long long time!!! I'm so excited. Gonna launch a new product next month. Can't wait to see how it converts.\"\n\n\"Great and friendly service. Awesome tools in Vidalytics! Compliments for the way it's designed!\"\n\nCancel anytime \u2014 either from your account page or by contacting us, and we\u2019ll still be friends.\n\nOh yeah! Anytime you like \u2014 you got it. You can do this from your account page.\n\nThe easiest thing to do is take your _average video size \u00d7 your number of videos \u00d7 number of plays._ Make sure it is in GB and BAM! That is your bandwidth. We know this is kind of ghetto, so until our team builds our bandwidth calculator, feel free to start a chat with us :) However, you should be happily surprised that you use a lot less bandwidth with Vidalytics, because we use true adaptive bitrate streaming. Other platforms claim they use adaptive bitrate streaming, but really only do on a small portion of their video streaming. Which is dumb. We\u2019re not dumb. We use it 100% of the time. This optimizes the size of your videos for each user, so they get the perfect size based on their internet connection speed. This means your videos are always super fast and play seamlessly for your users with nearly no buffering ever. And you\u2019ll save big on your bandwidth bill.\n\nYou can store as many videos as you want if you're on a paid plan. They will cost a small charge of 25\u00a2 per video. This is all automatic. Just add \u2018em and we\u2019ll handle it. Our Free plan comes with space for 3 videos. If you need more space, you can upgrade anytime ;)\n\nYES! Other analytics tools, like Google Analytics, are super confusing and overly-complex, because they were built by a committee of technical people who tried to solve everyone\u2019s wants, dreams and desires. Vidalytics\u00ae is built for one person \u2014 the **marketer.**Whether you\u2019re doing branding, lead gen, straight sale, product explainer videos, training videos or even product content \u2014 we built Vidalytics for you. Because, when you\u2019re a marketer, you care about very specific metrics. Not a billion, not even a 100. We put the dozen plus metrics that you need to make decisions about your marketing videos right at your fingertips. And our UI is super sexy, incredibly intuitive and easy to use. Plus, we hold regular training webinars on using our software, so you get the most out of it and the latest tactics in video conversions.\n\nYep! You can change anything on the player \u2014 the colors of the foreground or background, remove or show any of the buttons. You can even enable auto-play, or disable pausing and seeking on your videos.\n\nYes! Vidalytics\u2019 player is a lean HTML5 responsive player ready for any sized screen.\n\nYes! Vidalytics transcodes your videos into several different sizes and formats so they can play on any device anywhere in the world.\n\nOh yeah! This is where we chop up your video into hundreds of little pieces and feed a few chunks to your user at a time. This 1) Saves you a ton on bandwidth. And 2) allows us to switch the size and quality midstream if your user\u2019s connection slows down. So your users almost never see a buffering video of yours. Because when videos buffer, we all suffer.\n\nBecause we care deeply about uptime. Nothing is more annoying than having traffic to your videos that don\u2019t play. This is a common occurrence on even large video networks, but we\u2019re dedicated to you \u2014 the marketer. We have 3 CDNs which are constantly being optimized for speed. We will always serve your video from the fastest one, even if it is a matter of milliseconds. Why? Because speed matters for conversions. Period.\n\nIf you\u2019re running a lot of volume (1 TB+), then we can definitely hook you up.
