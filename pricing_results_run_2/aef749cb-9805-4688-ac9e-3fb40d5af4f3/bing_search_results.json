Supporting this setup is non-trivial, and is a **$50/month** addon only available on our **Ghost(Pro) Business** plan.\n\nWe only recommend this setup for teams who are very comfortable with complex technical infrastructure and are willing to put in the time and resources needed to maintain it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n | No | No | No | \\+ $50/mo |\n\n### Support\n\nSupport comparison\n| Feature | Starter plan | Creator plan | Team plan | Business plan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Product help | Email support | Email support | Priority support | Account manager |\n| Uptime SLA | No | No | No | 99.9% uptime SLA |\n\nLaunch your site\n----------------\n\nLast week, 5,069 brand new  \npublications got started with Ghost.\n\nToday, it's your turn.\n\n[Start a free trial now \u2192](https://account.ghost.org/signup/)\n\n[](https://ghost.org/) [About](https://ghost.org/about/) [Explore](https://ghost.org/explore/) [Careers](https://careers.ghost.org/) [Resources](https://ghost.org/resources/)\n\nProduct\n\n*   [Creator platform](https://ghost.org/)\n*   [Theme marketplace](https://ghost.org/marketplace/)\n*   [Integrations](https://ghost.org/integrations/)\n*   [Experts](https://ghost.org/experts/)\n*   [Ghost for news](https://ghost.org/news/)\n\nDevelopers\n\n*   [How to install Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/install/)\n*   [Core concepts](https://ghost.org/docs/)\n*   [Ghost hosting](https://ghost.org/pricing/)\n*   [API documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/)\n*   [Security overview](https://ghost.org/docs/security/)\n*   [Source code](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost)\n\nResources\n\n*   [Ghost tutorials](https://ghost.org/tutorials/)\n*   [Resources](https://ghost.org/resources/)\n*   [Node.js CMS guide](https://nodecms.guide/)\n*   [Open Subscription Platforms](https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/)\n\nComparisons\n\n*   [Ghost vs Substack](https://ghost.org/vs/substack/)\n*   [Ghost vs WordPress](https://ghost.org/vs/wordpress/)\n*   [Ghost vs Medium](https://ghost.org/vs/medium/)\n*   [Ghost vs Memberful](https://ghost.org/vs/memberful/)\n*   [Ghost vs Patreon](https://ghost.org/vs/patreon/)\n*   [Ghost alternatives \u2192](https://ghost.org/alternatives/)\n\nSupport\n\n*   [Help center](https://ghost.org/help/)\n*   [Community forum](https://forum.ghost.org/)\n*   [Status 99.9%](https://status.ghost.org/)\n\n[![Image 1: Non-Profit Foundation](https://ghost.org/images/logos/indie.svg)](https://ghost.org/about/) [![Image 2: Open Source](https://ghost.org/images/logos/opensource.svg)](https://github.com/tryghost) [![Image 3: Carbon Neutral](https://ghost.org/images/logos/carbonneutral.svg)](https://climate.stripe.com/6MNofu)\n\n[Terms](https://ghost.org/terms/) [Privacy](https://ghost.org/privacy/) [Contact](https://ghost.org/contact/) [Ghost Foundation \u00a9 2025](https://ghost.org/)\n\nThe best Ghost managed hosting from the creators of the open source publishing platform.
