If your training content is scattered all over the place and you're struggling to delegate responsibilities, Trainual is for you! Our typical customer is a small to medium size business with 5-500 employees. Trainual is a favorite among entrepreneurs and CEOs, HR and Operations leaders, office managers and admins, because Trainual helps standardize the way work gets done, streamline onboarding and training processes, ensure all employees have the knowledge they need to do their best work, and keep teams aligned and accountable no matter where they work from. Trainual is not an enterprise tool, though there are teams in the thousands who find success with Trainual for specific use cases. Get in touch to learn more about Trainual and how it might work for your type of business and use cases.\n\n![Image 16: Dropdown arrow](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61aa482275701e897156da77/61aa482275701e61cc56dbe8_DropdownDark.svg)\n\n##### Is there a free trial period?\n\nYes! You can try any Trainual plan free for 7-days by simply setting up a password. No credit card needed.\n\n![Image 17: Dropdown arrow](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61aa482275701e897156da77/61aa482275701e61cc56dbe8_DropdownDark.svg)\n\n##### Is Trainual hard to use?\n\nNope! Trainual is super intuitive. In fact, Trainual has been voted \"#1 Easiest To Use\" small business onboarding, training, and SOP software by reviewers on G2 every year since 2019. Adding your team is quick, building your content is as easy as writing an email, and rolling out training happens in just a few clicks. Now, we're not saying it doesn't take time! Documenting stuff about your business isn't the most automated of processes...though our AI writing feature does help speed things up! But the time you put in, you get back ten-fold. And to get back to the question, no it's not hard to use :)\n\n![Image 18: Dropdown arrow](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61aa482275701e897156da77/61aa482275701e61cc56dbe8_DropdownDark.svg)\n\n##### Does it take a long time to create training content?\n\nNot anymore! If you have existing training content, you can now import a Google Doc or Word file directly into Trainual. Or, if you're starting from scratch, you can leverage the build-in AI capabilities to generate new content by prompting our \ud83e\ude84 Compose feature with a few bullet points. Need a little inspiration?\u00a0We also have hundreds of templates for you to get started with. Documenting your business playbook does take time, but we promise to make it as easy and painless as possible.\n\n![Image 19: Dropdown arrow](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61aa482275701e897156da77/61aa482275701e61cc56dbe8_DropdownDark.svg)\n\n##### If you had one shot, one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted, would you capture it?\n\nYes, we would.
