All of them are chargeable, apart from the Client role, which is for free. The number of chargeable users allowed in a system varies based on the subscription plan. The Plus plan is limited to 3 users with chargeable roles, whereas with the Pro plan, you can have as many chargeable users as you want.\n\nA non-chargeable role is a user in your ActiveCollab that you do not pay for, the user with a Client role. You can have as many Clients as you wish free of charge in any of the subscription plans.\n\nIt means you can invite as many people as you wish with just a Client role for free. Clients do not affect the number of chargeable users and do not take up a seat in plans with limited seats.\n\nThe Plus plan is ideal for smaller teams and offers a set of features for collaboration and communication. It holds up to three seats for chargeable users. The account creator is, by default, an Owner, and you can invite two more chargeable users and unlimited Clients.\n\nThe Pro plan includes all the features that ActiveCollab offers in the core package, and you can extend the list of features by getting the Get Paid Bundle on top of the Pro plan. You are charged for each chargeable user in the account, and you can invite an unlimited number of users with a Client role that won't be charged.\n\nThe pricing is lower for a yearly subscription, and it gives you up to 15% off of the price if you commit to the annual subscription for both Plus and Pro plans. You pay for the period of your choice ahead, so you will be issued an invoice for the month ahead if you choose monthly. If you choose a yearly plan, you will be issued an invoice for the one year ahead.\n\nActiveCollab is subscription-based, and as long as you are subscribed to ActiveCollab, the payments will go through automatically.\n\nGet Paid Bundle is an additional set of features that you can buy to upgrade the Pro plan. The Get Paid Bundle can only be added to the Pro plan. You can't purchase the Get Paid bundle if you're on the Plus plan.\n\nGet Paid Bundle is a set of features charged additionally to the core set of features. Get Paid Bundle can only be purchased with a Pro plan. If you use the Plus plan, you must first upgrade to the Pro plan to buy the Get Paid Bundle. Each chargeable user in ActiveCollab will be charged for the Get Paid Bundle. The pricing is an additional 3 USD per month, per user, for the annual plans - charged at once for an entire year. Pricing for the Get Paid Bundle per month is an additional 4 USD per month per member.\n\nActiveCollab is designed to be a hub for your organization.
