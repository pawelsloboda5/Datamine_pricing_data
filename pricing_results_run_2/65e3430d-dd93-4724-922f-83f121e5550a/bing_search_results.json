On the monthly plan, you pay month-to-month for more flexibility.\n    \n    Adding and removing users works differently as well. For an annual subscription, your first bill is based on how many users you have. Then if and when you add a\u00a0user, you\u2019ll be charged a\u00a0one-time amount, prorated starting the day you add them. When you deactivate a\u00a0user on an annual plan, you\u2019ll have an empty seat that you can fill with a\u00a0new user. If you never fill that empty seat, your next annual bill will reflect your current user\u00a0number.\n    \n*   [### Which plan should I choose if I want to use the AI features?](https://companycam.com/pricing#question-3)\n    \n    Our Pro subscription gives you 10 credits to try out our AI-powered actions, shared across your entire company. When you use an AI action, your number of credits will go down, and deleting an action you\u2019ve already used won\u2019t increase the number of credits you\u00a0have.\n    \n    For unlimited AI access, choose a\u00a0Premium or Elite\u00a0plan!\n    \n*   [### How long do you store my photos?](https://companycam.com/pricing#question-4)\n    \n    Forever! As long as you\u2019re a\u00a0CompanyCam customer, we won\u2019t delete any of your photos. If you stay with us for 10\u00a0years, you\u2019ll have 10\u00a0years worth of photos, nicely organized right where you can find them. If you ever quit using CompanyCam, you can download your photos before you\u00a0cancel.\n    \n*   [### If I dismiss or lose an employee do I lose their photos?](https://companycam.com/pricing#question-5)\n    \n    Nope. Every photo that anyone at your company takes using the CompanyCam app is stored in the cloud in your account. If you dismiss an employee, just delete them from your account. You will still have all of their photos, but they won\u2019t be able to access them.\n    \n*   [### Does CompanyCam use a lot of memory on my phone?](https://companycam.com/pricing#question-6)\n    \n    Not at all. CompanyCam saves your work photos in the cloud so they don\u2019t clutter up your camera roll or take up space on your\u00a0device.\n    \n*   [### Are my photos secure?](https://companycam.com/pricing#question-7)\n    \n    Very secure. We use Amazon\u2019s S3 Cloud to store photos securely online. We also use SSL encryption to form a\u00a0secure connection with the server while we\u2019re transferring photos. Only you (and your company) have access to your\u00a0photos.\n    \n*   [### Can I switch from an annual to monthly subscription?](https://companycam.com/pricing#question-8)\n    \n    You sure can. At the end of your one-year subscription, you can switch back to monthly before you auto-renew and get charged for another year. You can cancel your annual subscription at any point, but you\u2019ll still have access to your account until the year is\u00a0over.\n    \n*   [### Do annual subscriptions auto-renew?](https://companycam.com/pricing#question-9)\n    \n    Yes\u2009\u2014\u2009we will send you a\u00a0reminder email before you are\u00a0charged.\n    \n*   [### Is the CompanyCam app available on iOS and Android devices?](https://companycam.com/pricing#question-10)\n    \n    Yep!\n    \n    One thing to note\u2009\u2014\u2009the ability to record in Dual Video Mode is currently exclusive to iOS users. The videos generated can then be viewed by\u00a0anyone!\n    \n    Other than that, the iOS and Android experiences are the\u00a0same.\n    \n\nCompanyCam helps contractors build trust with their crews and customers through photo documentation.
