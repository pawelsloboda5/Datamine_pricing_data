One, it attracts more customers with its lower entry point (e.g. paying $15 monthly vs. $150 upfront). Two, it offers more predictable revenue for businesses. And three, it allows businesses to build stronger, more valuable relationships with their customers.\n\n### What is the difference between a subscription and a license?\n\nThe difference between a subscription and a license is that a license is typically sold as a one-time charge and allows the user to access the product indefinitely, while a subscription is billed on a recurring basis and provides user access only while they continue to pay the subscription fee.\n\n### How does a subscription management model work?\n\nSubscription management business models are based on the idea of selling a product or service to receive monthly or yearly recurring subscription revenue.\n\n\u00b9During the first three (3) months of any Starter (formerly Core) subscription that started on or after January 1, 2023 (Promotional Period), a Qualifying New Merchant will not be charged a monthly platform fee and will not be charged fees for their Total Payment Volume (TPV) unless their TPV exceeds $40,000 USD or the Euro or British pound equivalent during a given month; Merchant will be charged a fee of 0.9% on all TPV beyond $40,000 USD per month. After the Promotional Period, unless Merchant cancels, Merchant will be charged a monthly platform fee of $249 USD per month and will not be charged fees for their Total Payment Volume (TPV) unless their TPV exceeds $40,000 USD during a given month; Merchant will be charged a fee of 0.9% on all TPV beyond $40,000 USD per month. Merchant bank account is required. Other fees may apply including Merchant bank account fees, payment gateway fees, and customer/card import fees. Merchants can cancel and close their Recurly account within the Admin section. Qualifying New Merchant means a Merchant that has not previously been a Recurly customer within the last 3 months. New or different subdomains from existing Merchants do not qualify for this promotion. Recurly reserves the right to cancel or modify the terms of this promotion in its sole discretion.\n\nMerchant bank account is required. Other fees apply including merchant bank account fees and payment gateway fees. Fees may apply to import existing cards/customers.\n\n![Image 14](https://recurly.com/img2/home/cta-bg.svg)\n\nRecurly is the leading subscription management & billing platform.
