We charge you only based on the number of attendees who will be able to attend your events and not on the number of events.\n\nHow does attendee-based pricing work?\n\nOur plans are based on the total number of attendees allowed in an event instead of the total number of those who registered. The plans are unlimited in nature, which means you can run as many events as you want as long as it is within the attendee limit of your plan.\n\nWhat will happen if I exceed my plan\u2019s attendee limit when my event is in progress?\n\nIf you exceed your attendee limit after your event starts, we will allow the additional attendees to enter the event. The charges for additional attendees will be billed to you after the event. You can also purchase extra attendee bundles prior to your event to act as a buffer. You can purchase attendee bundles in bulk and as individual units as per your requirement.\n\nHow will I be billed for extra attendees beyond the attendee limit?\n\nYou can pay for extra attendees by enabling pay-as-you-go on your card. Once the event is completed, the card will automatically be debited for the extra attendees who joined.\n\nDo the add-ons work at an event level or plan-level?\n\nAirCare bundles can be purchased and used across your events. Each AirCare bundle comes with a specific number of events that you can use them for. Product add-ons are applicable at an event level. Standalone add-ons are applicable at a plan level.\n\n![Image 204](blob:http://localhost/787862a49638a09e7c3f950cd4e6135f)\n\n![Image
