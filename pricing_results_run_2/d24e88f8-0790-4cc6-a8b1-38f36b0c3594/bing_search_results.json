like to use CallPage, [please get in touch and ask for individual pricing.](https://callpage.io/contact)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHave more questions? Contact us at [support@callpage.io](mailto:support@callpage.io)\n\n*   What\u2019s the difference between a user license and a call operator?\n    \n    The user license provides full access to the CallPage admin panel. This enables users to check leads and recordings, answer incoming calls, and make calls from the panel. Users can also sync their account with their calendar to use CallPage Meetings. The call operator role is limited to answering incoming calls ordered by the CallPage widget.\n    \n*   Are the prices listed above net prices?\n    \n    Yes, the prices listed in the price list are net prices. In Poland, an additional 23% VAT is added to these net prices.\n    \n*   What\u2019s a successful call?\n    \n    A successful call is one that was answered by both parties and lasted longer than 10 seconds. Such a call can be either incoming if a website visitor orders the call using the CallPage widget, or outgoing if a user makes a call from the CallPage panel.\n    \n*   How does the free trial work?\n    \n    After creating your 14-day free trial, you will get access to the admin panel and all CallPage features from the Pro plan. Among other things, you\u2019ll be able to test the CallPage widget (by installing your unique widget on the website), create a Meetings form, or test a Virtual Phone Number. After 14 days, you can either buy a subscription or resign. In the second case, your account will be automatically moved to a freeze status.\n    \n*   How to install CallPage on my website?\n    \n    There are several available installation methods to choose from. You can use CMS plugins (e.g. for WordPress), Google Tag Manager or copy/paste the installation code directly into your site's code. Once you sign up for a free account, you will receive detailed instructions.\n    \n*   Do I need credit card to use CallPage?\n    \n    You do not need to add a credit card to start your free trial. However, you will need a card to sign up for the subscription plan.\n    \n*   What happens if I exceed the limit?\n    \n    We'll provide you with advance notifications before you reach your limit. You can ignore the limit, but that will temporarily disable customer calls once you reach it (until the subscription renews and the limit resets). Or, you can easily increase your successful call limit right from the CallPage panel to ensure you don't miss out on potential leads.\n    \n*   Can I cancel my subscription?\n    \n    Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time directly in your CallPage panel. If you cancel, you\u2019ll be able to continue using CallPage until the end of your subscription period. After that date, we\u2019ll automatically freeze your account.\n    \n*   What if someone tries to spam my widget?\n    \n    Our anti-fraud system automatically blocks any IP address that engages in suspicious activity, such as requesting callbacks multiple times over a short time. You can also access a blacklist through the admin panel and add any phone numbers from which you don\u2019t want to receive calls.\n    \n\n### Start generating leads today!\n\n#### Get a 14-day free trial now,\n\nset up the widget on your site, and see how many more leads you can capture with CallPage\n\n*   No credit card required\n*   10 minutes set up\n*   14 days fully-features free trial\n\nTry for freeWatch a Demo\n\n*   ##### Product\n    \n    *   [Click-to-call widget](https://www.callpage.io/click-to-call-widget)\n    *   [Meeting scheduling](https://www.callpage.io/meeting-scheduling-tool)\n    *   [Lead distribution](https://www.callpage.io/lead-automation)\n    *   [Virtual PBX](https://www.callpage.io/virtual-PBX)\n*   ##### Solutions\n    \n    *   [Healthcare](https://www.callpage.io/healthcare)\n    *   [Education](https://www.callpage.io/education)\n    *   [Business services](https://www.callpage.io/business-services)\n    *   [Real Estate](https://www.callpage.io/real-estate)\n    *   [Automotive](https://www.callpage.io/automotive)\n    *   [Ecommerce](https://www.callpage.io/ecommerce)\n    *   [Travel](https://www.callpage.io/travel)\n*   ##### Resources\n    \n    *   [Blog](https://www.callpage.io/blog)\n    *   [Ebooks](https://www.callpage.io/ebooks)\n    *   [Integrations](https://www.callpage.io/integrations)\n    *   [Pricing](https://www.callpage.io/pricing)\n    *   [Knowledge base](https://www.callpage.io/knowledgebase)\n    *   [Affiliate Program](https://www.callpage.io/partners)\n    *   [For developers](https://www.callpage.io/developers)\n    *   [FAQ](https://www.callpage.io/faq)\n*   ##### Company\n    \n    *   [About](https://www.callpage.io/about)\n    *   [Case Studies](https://www.callpage.io/clients)\n    *   [Contact](https://www.callpage.io/contact)\n    *   [Privacy policy](https://www.callpage.io/privacy-policy)\n    *   [Terms and conditions](https://www.callpage.io/terms-of-service)\n    *   [CallPage security and data storage](https://www.callpage.io/callpage-security-and-data-storage)\n    *   [Terms and conditions of the Affiliate Program](https://www.callpage.io/terms-and-conditions-partners)\n*   ##### Use Cases\n    \n    *   [Lead Generation](https://www.callpage.io/lead-generation)\n    *   [Increase Sales](https://www.callpage.io/time-to-lead)\n    *   [Improve UX](https://www.callpage.io/improve-ux)\n    *   [Capture more leads](https://www.callpage.io/lead-capture-software)\n\nCallPage 2025 All Rights Reserved[](https://www.callpage.io/)\n\n[](https://www.instagram.com/callpage.io/)[](https://www.facebook.com/callpage.io/)[](https://twitter.com/callpage_io)[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/call-page/)[](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY7X8vYRlDPj9U3Z5aoRcvA)\n\n \n\n[Powered by ![Image 45: ](blob:http://localhost/314ba1badaf53a680353a36c24cd28bd) ![Image 46: ](blob:http://localhost/b23c22bb368ceb1f83814bdb969460b7)](https://www.callpage.io/?utm_source=www.callpage.io&utm_medium=widget)  \n\nThis is CallPage.
