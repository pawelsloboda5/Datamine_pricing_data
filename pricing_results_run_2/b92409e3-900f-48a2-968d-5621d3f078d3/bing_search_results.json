For instance, you might set up a monthly subscription, like $34, giving your clients ongoing access to your content and features. This is a fantastic way to build a steady, ongoing revenue stream.\n\nYou can also charge a one-time fee for special courses or premium content. For example, pricing something at $15,600 or more is perfectly feasible.\n\nIf you are just getting started, it\u2019s often best to begin with one main offer. This helps you focus your efforts, build confidence, and understand your audience better. As you grow, you can introduce additional offers and adjust your pricing. We have a proven system to help you nail down your niche, craft compelling offers, and set the right prices. Dan explains it here.\n\nThe more engaging and interactive a customer\u2019s experience is, the higher the perceived value is. That\u2019s why people with custom apps can charge more than traditional online courses hosted on big platforms.\n\n#### What kind of people and brands use Passion.io?\n\n![Image 97](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/606317d685e6b189218df406/60afab0b202f53c8093e04cf_Vector.svg)\n\nWe have 10,000+ creators spanning a variety of use cases and niches.
