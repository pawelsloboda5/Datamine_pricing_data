following\n--------------------------------\n\n![Image 485](https://www.appointlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/plan-icon-1.svg)\n\nMinimize No-Shows\n\nMake sure your attendees never lose track of a meeting again. Send automated confirmation and reminder emails to people who tend to have a busier schedule than most.\n\n![Image 486](https://www.appointlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/plan-icon-2.svg)\n\nCustom Intake forms\n\nReduce the anxiety around meetings by requesting all the relevant information you\u2019ll need from your attendees during the scheduling process.\n\n![Image 487](https://www.appointlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/plan-icon-3.svg)\n\nShow up prepared\n\nAdd extra information on the fly.

We\u2019ve got answers!\n----------------------------------\n\nHow long does the free plan last?\n\nWhen you first sign up, Appointlet puts you on the Free plan. You are free to use it for as long as you like. If you decide to Upgrade to the Premium plan and benefit from the premium features, you can do so at anytime from the billing page.\n\nIs there special pricing for educators / nonprofits?\n\nYes, Appointlet offers a 25% discount for accredited educational institutions and non profits. You can contact support and submit proof of your company\u2019s status to request the discount.\n\nHow many members and bookings can I have on the free plan?\n\nThe free plan currently supports unlimited members and unlimited bookings.\n\nWhat's the cancellation policy?\n\nYou can cancel your premium subscription at any time. Service will be retained through the duration of your subscription period.\n\nAre the monthly and annual subscriptions recurring?\n\nYes, once you select a billing cycle, the charge will recur at the same time each month (or year) until you change your plan.\n\nDo you offer refunds?\n\nYou will qualify for a refund if you received no bookings during your current cycle. Refunds are intended for organizations that accidentally renewed a subscription and did not use it. We do not offer refunds for prior subscription cycles, regardless of use. It's your responsibility to monitor your use and cancel when you no longer need the service.\n\nHow does adding or removing users impact pricing?\n\nOur billing system calculates prorations based on the remaining time in your current subscription cycle. So if you add a new user mid-cycle, you don\u2019t pay full price that first month. If you delete a member from your Appointlet organization, a prorated credit will be applied to your account. These will display in your administrators billing screen.\n\nWhat payment methods can I use?\n\nWe accept debit and credit card payment for monthly and annual subscriptions. Organizations that prefer to pay for an annual subscription with e-check (ACH) can contact support for details on how to submit a request.\n\n![Image 512](https://www.appointlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pointy-desk-1.svg)\n\n[![Image 513](https://www.appointlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/brand-logo.svg)](https://www.appointlet.com/)\n\nThe simple and affordable way to book meetings online\n\n [![Image 514](https://www.appointlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/facebook-logo-blue.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/Appointlet)[![Image 515](https://www.appointlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/linkedin-logo-blue.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/appointlet)[![Image 516](https://www.appointlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/twitter-logo-blue.svg)](https://twitter.com/appointlet)[![Image 517](https://www.appointlet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/instagram-logo-blue.svg)](https://www.instagram.com/appointlet.scheduling/)\n\nGeneral\n\n*   [Teams](https://www.appointlet.com/teams)\n*   [Features](https://www.appointlet.com/features)\n*   [Pricing](https://www.appointlet.com/pricing)\n*   [Login](https://app.appointlet.com/unified_login?check_v4)\n*   [Start free](https://app.appointlet.com/signup)\n\nUse cases\n\n*   [Education](https://www.appointlet.com/online-scheduling-for-educators)\n*   [Retail Services](https://www.appointlet.com/scheduling-solutions-for-retail-stores)\n*   [Health & Wellness](https://www.appointlet.com/scheduling-for-health-wellness)\n*   [Legal & Financial](https://www.appointlet.com/scheduling-for-legal-and-financial)\n*   [Recruiting & HR](https://www.appointlet.com/applicant-scheduling-for-recruiters)\n*   [Property Management](https://www.appointlet.com/online-scheduling-for-property-managers)\n*   [Sales & Marketing](https://www.appointlet.com/use-case-sales-and-marketing)\n*   [Customer Success](https://www.appointlet.com/online-scheduling-for-customer-success)\n\nCompany\n\n*   [About](https://www.appointlet.com/about)\n*   [Blog](https://www.appointlet.com/blog)\n*   [Support](https://www.appointlet.com/faqs)\n*   [Help Center](http://kb.appointlet.help/en/)\n*   [Affiliate Program](https://www.appointlet.com/affiliate)\n*   [Partnerships](mailto:partnerships@appointlet.com)\n\nIntegrations\n\n*   [Google Calendar](https://www.appointlet.com/integrations/google-calendar)\n*   [Office 365](https://www.appointlet.com/integrations/office-365)\n*   [Zoom](https://www.appointlet.com/integrations/zoom)\n*   [View All](https://www.appointlet.com/integrations)\n\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.appointlet.com/privacy-policy)\n*   [Terms of Service](https://www.appointlet.com/terms-and-conditions)\n\n\u00a9 2024 Appointlet - All rights reserved\n\nJoin 158,000+ users that trust Appointlet for faster, simpler scheduling.
