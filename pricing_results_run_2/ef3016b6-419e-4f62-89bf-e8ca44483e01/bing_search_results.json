The most obvious way is to increase the cost of your event price by your expected fee expense. You can see how to calculate your fees in our help article [How to save on online payment service fees](https://help.corsizio.com/article/60-how-to-save-on-online-payment-service-fees). Many attendees get put off by the idea of having to pay event registration fees and this allows you to bundle the cost as part of the event and minimize the risk of losing a registration. If you are okay with having your attendees see the fees separately, you can use the event price add-on feature and make it a mandatory part of their registration.\n\n[### What if my events are free, for charity, or not-for-profit?](https://www.corsizio.com/pricing#Q07)You are welcome to use Corsizio for any such event needs and will not incur any charges for your registrations if you have low-volume usage, as per [our pricing](https://www.corsizio.com/pricing). We aim to provide everyone equally with an ultra-low, highly discounted, pay-per-use, and cost-effective model for higher volume needs, while offering full access to all of our features, support, security, data storage, and service value. Therefore, cost is dependent on volume of usage and not on the event price or purpose.\n\n[![Image 2: Capterra Best Ease of Use for Class Registration 2023](https://brand-assets.capterra.com/badge/f67318b8-b3d3-425b-bed3-085d8bc9b745.png)](https://www.capterra.com/p/148885/Corsizio/ \"Best Ease of Use Badge\")\n\n[![Image 3: Capterra Best Value for Event Booking 2023](https://brand-assets.capterra.com/badge/b7a17a5d-ee5e-4696-904a-b5c7e5e2d9c2.png)](https://www.capterra.com/p/148885/Corsizio/ \"Best Value Badge\")\n\n[![Image 4: GetApp Category Leaders for Registration 2024](https://brand-assets.getapp.com/badge/591e788b-299e-43ca-90f2-acba7f3f47c4.png)](https://www.getapp.com/website-ecommerce-software/registration/category-leaders/ \"Category Leaders Badge\")\n\n[![Image 5: Software Advice Most Recommended for Registration 2024](https://brand-assets.softwareadvice.com/badge/5472c4ea-efcb-4855-839b-84aed4160919.png)](https://www.softwareadvice.com/event-booking/corsizio-profile/ \"Most Recommended Badge\")\n\n[![Image 6: Software Advice Front Runners for Registration 2024](https://brand-assets.softwareadvice.com/badge/fc9623a6-bac7-4c4f-b129-20003e40881e.png)](https://www.softwareadvice.com/registration/#frontrunners \"Front Runners Badge\")\n\nThe Gartner Digital Markets badges from Capterra, GetApp, and SoftwareAdvice are trademarks and service marks of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates are used herein with permission.
