\n  How can I create, update, or delete my subscription?    \n \n\nIf you are a Google Workspace customer, your admin can manage subscriptions through the Google Admin Console. If you have an individual account, please follow these instructions on how to manage your subscription plan.   \n \n  What can I do at no cost?    \n \n\nUse basic app and automation features at no cost while building one or many app prototypes. Invite up to 10 test users at no cost to use your apps and share feedback.   \n \n  If I\u2019m a Google Workspace customer, what do I have access to?    \n \n\nSome Google Workspace subscriptions include access to AppSheet Core for creating and sharing applications within the organization, with options to upgrade to AppSheet Enterprise for advanced integrations and admin governance features. Learn More   \n \n  How do I start my subscription?    \n \n\nIf you are a Google Workspace customer, your admin can manage subscriptions through the Google Admin Console. If you have an individual account, visit the billing settings on the My Account page of the AppSheet platform. Choose your subscription based on the features your apps require. You can also update the number of app user licenses and your credit card details.   \n \n  Where can I monitor my app usage?    \n \n\nAn overview of all your app usage is available in the 'My Account' section of the platform, within the 'App Info' tab. Detailed app usage is also available in the app editor in the Manage section within the Monitor tab of each app.   \n \n  How long do I have to test features?    \n \n\nAs long as you'd like. We encourage you to try out all the features of the platform in the prototype phase for one or multiple apps.   \n \n  How does AppSheet define a user?    \n \n\nThere are two types of users: signed-in users and guest/external users. AppSheet will count unique individuals that have signed in across all apps in your account as signed-in users. Users that are not signed in are counted as guest users. That means that if an employee opens an app that does not require sign in on two devices, AppSheet will count two guest users rather than one. Note that while guest users are typically counted by device, a new guest user could be generated anytime someone opens your app based on their device settings. You need to purchase the number of licenses equal to the total number of users (signed-in and guest/external) you plan to have.   \n \n  Is there a discount for non-profits?    \n \n\nYes, we offer discounts for educational and non-profit organizations with verification of tax-exempt status.   \n \n  How often does AppSheet bill subscribers?    \n \n\nBilling is based on your plan and will either occur monthly or annually.   \n \n  Where can I see my invoices?    \n \n\nIf you are a Google Workspace customer, your admin can manage billing through the Google Admin Console. If you have an individual account, monthly subscriptions are automatically invoiced, and transaction history is available in the Billing tab of the My Account page.   \n \n  Is AI-assisted app creation in AppSheet available to me?    \n \n\nAI-assisted app creation is available to AppSheet users with paid Google Workspace licenses. More details are available in the AppSheet Documentation.   \n \n  Is it possible to purchase AppSheet without purchasing Google Workspace?    \n \n\nYes, if you are using AppSheet for an individual account, then you can sign up for AppSheet Starter, Core, or Publisher Pro without a Google Workspace account. If you are purchasing AppSheet Core or AppSheet Enterprise Plus on behalf of your organization, you can sign up for Cloud Identity Free and then complete the purchase in the Google Admin Console. Note that you will need to verify ownership of your domain to complete the purchase.         \n \n \n \n \nNeed Public Apps? \nPublicly accessible applications that don't contain sensitive data and don't require user sign-in can be created with an AppSheet Publisher Pro subscription. These apps include the feature sets of the AppSheet Core Plan, but do not include user sign-in options or the use of security filters. Publisher Pro apps can be used by an unlimited number of users for $50/mo/app. Learn more  \n     \n \n \n \nTry AppSheet at no cost \nUse the app editor and process designer at no cost.
