There are no long-term contracts with SegMetrics. You pick if you want monthly or annual billing, and you can cancel at any time.\n\nCan I change plans at any time?\n\nYes! Simply click on the \u201cAccount\u201d tab on your dashboard to see your options.\n\nDo you have a guarantee?\n\nYes! Simply put, if you\u2019re not thrilled with SegMetrics, we don\u2019t want your money. If you\u2019re unsatisfied for any reason, we will refund any payment made within the last 30 days.\n\nSegMetrics also comes with a 14-day free trial. Try any tier, risk-free, and decide for yourself if SegMetrics is right for you!\n\nHow are you different from other analytics tools?\n\nSegMetrics focuses on middle-of-funnel engagement by tracking interactions like tag applications and marketing activities.\n\nWith a native ESP connection, we provide deeper insights into how your leads are progressing through the funnel, helping you understand what\u2019s truly driving conversions.\n\nIs it hard to switch to SegMetrics if I have other analytics set up?\n\nNot at all! We\u2019ll automatically import your existing data from the marketing tools that you already use. Plus, as part of our\u00a0**onboarding data setup call**\u00a0we\u2019ll help you get set up with all the tracking and data that we don\u2019t bring in automatically.\n\nIf I have questions, who can I talk to?\n\nYou can email us at [support@segmetrics.io](mailto:support@segmetrics.io), or chat with us using the beacon below!\n\nDiscover the untapped profits hiding in your marketing\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Start Your Free Trial](https://app.segmetrics.io/signup/)\n\n[Schedule a demo](https://segmetrics.io/book-a-demo/)\n\n \n\nProduct\n\n*   [Pricing](https://segmetrics.io/pricing/)\n*   [Partner Directory](https://segmetrics.io/agency/partners/)\n*   [SegMetrics for Agencies](https://segmetrics.io/agency/)\n*   [Become an Agency Partner](https://segmetrics.io/agency/join-the-partner-directory/)\n*   [Become an Affiliate](https://segmetrics.io/partners/affiliates/)\n*   [Start Your Free Trial](https://app.segmetrics.io/signup/)\n\n*   [Pricing](https://segmetrics.io/pricing/)\n*   [Partner Directory](https://segmetrics.io/agency/partners/)\n*   [SegMetrics for Agencies](https://segmetrics.io/agency/)\n*   [Become an Agency Partner](https://segmetrics.io/agency/join-the-partner-directory/)\n*   [Become an Affiliate](https://segmetrics.io/partners/affiliates/)\n*   [Start Your Free Trial](https://app.segmetrics.io/signup/)\n\nLearn More\n\n*   [Building Quizzes that Convert](https://segmetrics.io/bonus/building-quizzes-that-convert/)\n*   [Calculate Lead Value](https://segmetrics.io/bonus/calculate-lead-value/)\n*   [Ultimate Tagging Guide](https://segmetrics.io/guides/ultimate-tagging-guide/)\n*   [Alternative to Google Analytics](https://segmetrics.io/compare/alternative-to-ga4/)\n*   [Alternative to Hyros](https://segmetrics.io/compare/alternative-to-hyros/)\n*   [Technology Partner Directory](https://segmetrics.io/technology/)\n*   [Customer Testimonials](https://segmetrics.io/testimonials/)\n*   [Articles](https://segmetrics.io/articles/)\n*   [Marketing Newsletter](https://segmetrics.io/newsletter/)\n\n*   [Building Quizzes that Convert](https://segmetrics.io/bonus/building-quizzes-that-convert/)\n*   [Calculate Lead Value](https://segmetrics.io/bonus/calculate-lead-value/)\n*   [Ultimate Tagging Guide](https://segmetrics.io/guides/ultimate-tagging-guide/)\n*   [Alternative to Google Analytics](https://segmetrics.io/compare/alternative-to-ga4/)\n*   [Alternative to Hyros](https://segmetrics.io/compare/alternative-to-hyros/)\n*   [Technology Partner Directory](https://segmetrics.io/technology/)\n*   [Customer Testimonials](https://segmetrics.io/testimonials/)\n*   [Articles](https://segmetrics.io/articles/)\n*   [Marketing Newsletter](https://segmetrics.io/newsletter/)\n\nSupport\n\n*   [Help Center](https://docs.segmetrics.io/)\n*   [Developer Docs](https://developers.segmetrics.io/)\n*   [System Status](https://segmetrics.statuspage.io/)\n*   [Changelog](https://changelog.segmetrics.io/)\n*   [Contact Us](https://docs.segmetrics.io/contact)\n\n*   [Help Center](https://docs.segmetrics.io/)\n*   [Developer Docs](https://developers.segmetrics.io/)\n*   [System Status](https://segmetrics.statuspage.io/)\n*   [Changelog](https://changelog.segmetrics.io/)\n*   [Contact Us](https://docs.segmetrics.io/contact)\n\nCompany\n\n*   [About Us](https://segmetrics.io/about-us/our-team/)\n*   [Work With Us](https://segmetrics.io/careers/)\n*   [Media and Interviews](https://segmetrics.io/media-and-interviews/)\n*   [Terms of Service](https://segmetrics.io/terms-service/)\n*   [Security](https://segmetrics.io/security/)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://segmetrics.io/privacy-policy/)\n\n*   [About Us](https://segmetrics.io/about-us/our-team/)\n*   [Work With Us](https://segmetrics.io/careers/)\n*   [Media and Interviews](https://segmetrics.io/media-and-interviews/)\n*   [Terms of Service](https://segmetrics.io/terms-service/)\n*   [Security](https://segmetrics.io/security/)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://segmetrics.io/privacy-policy/)\n\n![Image 24](https://segmetrics.io/nitropack_static/PSYxmairsrzwLFRgzNFmtFkEqMHSrgIT/assets/images/optimized/rev-013cf93/segmetrics.io/wp-content/uploads/logo-white-2400.png)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/segmetrics/) [Facebook](https://facebook.com/segmetrics/) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@segmetrics) [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/segmetrics/) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/segmetrics)\n\n\u00a9 2025 SegMetrics, Inc\n\n4.7/5 based on 2,374 reviews | GDPR Compliant Choose the plan that's right for your business All plans are 100% risk-free with our 14-day free trial!Are",
