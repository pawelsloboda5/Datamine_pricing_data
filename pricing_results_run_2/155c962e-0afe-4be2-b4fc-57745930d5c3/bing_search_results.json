Automated means that is not the case. You can set up your webinars once and they will run as frequently as you desire for as long as you desire.\n\n#### What does Stealthseminar do?\n\nStealthSeminar offers one of a kind functionality for webinars including Live, Automated, Live Chat and Hybrid Webinars (part automated and part live).\n\n#### What webinar pages are included?\n\nThe entire webinar funnel; Webinar Registration Page, Thank You for Registering Page, Event Page, Event Over Page and Replay Page.\n\n#### Can I localize the language on the webinar pages to my language? Same question for Webinar reminder emails?\n\nWe have clients all around the world that use our system with their desired language including: French, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and more. The only exception is for character based language such as japanese, etc.\n\n#### How is your support?\n\nWe have technicians available to help you seven days a week 362 days out of the year. We take three holidays a year; Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years. Many say our support is of the best online they have ever experienced.\n\nEverything you need to know about our Starter, Growth, and Power Plans.",
