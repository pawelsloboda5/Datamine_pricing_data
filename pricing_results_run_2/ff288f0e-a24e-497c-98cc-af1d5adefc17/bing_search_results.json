A credit is used when you parse an email or a document **for the first time**. 1 parsed document or PDF page equals 1, 2, or 5 credits, depending on the parser type (template-based, OCR, AI, or GPT-powered).\n\n#### Do you offer a free trial?\n\nYes! Our Sandbox plan includes enough credits to test all three parsers: template-based, AI, and GPT-powered. All features are included in the free plan, allowing you to fully test Parsio before committing to a paid subscription.\n\n#### What happens to unused credits at the end of the billing period?\n\nUnused credits expire at the end of each billing period. To make the most of your subscription, it is important to use all of your allotted credits before the end of your current billing period.\n\n#### Do you offer discounts?\n\nYes. When you pay for a year up front, you can enjoy a **~17% discount**. At this time, we do not have any other promotions, campaigns, offers, or discounts available, including during Black Friday.\n\n#### What happens once I have used all my credits?\n\nYour Parsio account can still receive emails, but they won't be parsed until the next billing period. Alternatively, you can upgrade your subscription to credit your account. You can also re-process any previously parsed emails & documents.\n\n#### Can I change my subscription?\n\nOur flexible subscription plans allow you to upgrade, downgrade or cancel your subscription at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately, while downgrades are scheduled for the end of your current billing cycle, so you can fully utilize your subscription. Cancellation is also possible at any time.\n\n#### What payment types do you accept?\n\nWe accept all major credit cards, including MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Diners, and JCB. We do not accept cryptocurrency, PayPal or bank transfers.\n\n#### How do I know it's safe to link my bank card?\n\nParsio never stores your bank card information. Your payment card details are encrypted and safely stored by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe).\n\n#### Can I get a refund?\n\nWe generally offer very limited refunds because you can test all the features using our Free plan before becoming a paid member. However, if you are unsatisfied with our services, please email us at [support@parsio.io](mailto:support@parsio.io).\n\n#### Can I get an invoice?\n\nYes, you can view and download your invoices from your Account \\> [Invoices & Usage](https://app.parsio.io/invoices) page.\n\n#### Do you offer high-volume plans?\n\nYes! Email us at [support@parsio.io](mailto:support@parsio.io) to discuss our high-volume pricing.\n\n#### I have another question.\n\nUse the chat box in the bottom right corner of this page or email us at [support@parsio.io](mailto:support@parsio.io).\n\nExtract data from emails, PDF, and documents. Export it to your Google Sheets, database, CRM, webhook and 6000+ apps.",
