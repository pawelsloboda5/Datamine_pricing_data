We use industry benchmarked encryption for all sensitive data in transit and at rest. We also regularly run internal and third party security screening and tests. Please reach out to us with any questions using the chat on the bottom right of your screen!\n\n_remove_\n\nCan I get a test environment if I do not want to publish my calculators?\n\nWhen you are in the Outgrow builder, you can preview the content before publishing. This way, the calculator will neither be made public nor will it get indexed in search engines. If you want to share among a larger group of people but not have it indexed by search engines, you can adjust the SEO settings in the configure tab and then publish the content.\n\n_remove_\n\nI am an agency and want to invite clients and remove Outgrow branding?\n\nWe do have a wide range of agency features, so you can invite clients, segment their analytics, automate reporting, and remove the Outgrow logo that appears on your published content. If you are interested in an agency plan use the chat on the bottom right of your screen to chat with us and we can help craft a plan for you and your clients.\n\n_remove_\n\nDo you charge per lead?\n\nNo, we don\u2019t charge per lead but we have tiers of leads based on the plan you are on.\n\n_remove_\n\nWhy should I upgrade?\n\nWell, with the interactive content you build on outgrow will help you better engage and build trust with your audience. So you can run effective lead generation programs, analyze the data about visitors, and you can use our premium design templates that are optimized across devices and browsers to make you look good online.\n\n_remove_\n\nI am an agency and want to refer clients instead of buying an agency account. Anything special for me?\n\nSure - If you are an agency that works with multiple clients, you do have the option to either get an agency account or refer your clients for an affiliate fee. We have a wide range of initiatives, features and incentives for agencies so feel free to reach out to us via the chat on the bottom right of your screen or via email at [questions@outgrow.co](mailto:questions@outgrow.co) so we can help you.\n\n_remove_\n\nHow many integrations do we get with each account?\n\nStandard plans come with one integration. With our agency, enterprise and custom plans, the number of integrations varies based on your specific needs. If you happen to have multiple Salesforce accounts, or you are an agency and want to connect all your clients CRMs or marketing automation tools, you can get an integration add on by contacting us here or via chat on the bottom right of your page.\n\n_remove_\n\nWhat happens during and after the trial period?\n\nDuring the trial you get access to the business plan for 7 days without needing to add a credit card. After the trial, you can add a card and choose a plan that works for you. Of course, make sure to use the chat on the bottom right of your screen for any questions, we\u2019d love to help!\n\n_remove_\n\nAny cancellation fees?\n\nWe have a simple SaaS based pricing model with monthly and annual plans. Cancellations take place at the end of your committed term.\n\n_remove_\n\nWhat are your billing cycles and payment options?\n\nOur two standard options are monthly or annual, with payments made upfront for the term. For smaller companies or companies that need payment plans, feel free to reach out to using the chat on the bottom right of your screen!\n\n_remove_\n\nCan we purchase lead add ons?\n\nYes if you max out the leads on your plan, you can either upgrade to a higher plan or we can craft a lead add on for you based on your needs.\n\n_remove_\n\nCan you build my calculators, quizzes, recommendations, assessments, chatbots etc for me?\n\nYes, we do have a custom build option and would be happy to help you. If you are interested in a custom build\n\n_remove_\n\nCan I build as many calculators, quizzes, chatbots, recommendation tools as I want on your essentials, business and enterprise plans?\n\nYes, there are so many possibilities and ideas for each of our content types so we have given unlimited content on some of our larger plans.\n\n_remove_\n\nWhich integrations do you have?\n\nWe have many native integrations including: Marketo, Salesforce, Eloqua, Hubspot, Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Slack, Constant Contact, Campaign Monitor, Aweber, Drip, Myemma, Get Response, Unbounce, Listrak, Sendlane, Zoho, Intercom, Facebook messenger, Pardot, Active Campaign, Keap/infusionsoft, Ontraport and many others. We also integrate with over 1000 tools via zapier.\n\n_remove_\n\nIs Outgrow Content accessible?\n\nWe have an accessibility toggle which leverages W3 guidelines of accessibility and allows a user to navigate with just a keyboard, they can understand questions / text using a screen reader, and the colors used will be ADA compliant so they can be seen by someone with color blindness.\n\nGet started with a free trial.

We use industry benchmarked encryption for all sensitive data in transit and at rest. We also regularly run internal and third party security screening and tests. Please reach out to us with any questions using the chat on the bottom right of your screen!\n\n_remove_\n\nCan I get a test environment if I do not want to publish my calculators?\n\nWhen you are in the Outgrow builder, you can preview the content before publishing. This way, the calculator will neither be made public nor will it get indexed in search engines. If you want to share among a larger group of people but not have it indexed by search engines, you can adjust the SEO settings in the configure tab and then publish the content.\n\n_remove_\n\nI am an agency and want to invite clients and remove Outgrow branding?\n\nWe do have a wide range of agency features, so you can invite clients, segment their analytics, automate reporting, and remove the Outgrow logo that appears on your published content. If you are interested in an agency plan use the chat on the bottom right of your screen to chat with us and we can help craft a plan for you and your clients.\n\n_remove_\n\nDo you charge per lead?\n\nNo, we don\u2019t charge per lead but we have tiers of leads based on the plan you are on.\n\n_remove_\n\nWhy should I upgrade?\n\nWell, with the interactive content you build on outgrow will help you better engage and build trust with your audience. So you can run effective lead generation programs, analyze the data about visitors, and you can use our premium design templates that are optimized across devices and browsers to make you look good online.\n\n_remove_\n\nI am an agency and want to refer clients instead of buying an agency account. Anything special for me?\n\nSure - If you are an agency that works with multiple clients, you do have the option to either get an agency account or refer your clients for an affiliate fee. We have a wide range of initiatives, features and incentives for agencies so feel free to reach out to us via the chat on the bottom right of your screen or via email at [questions@outgrow.co](mailto:questions@outgrow.co) so we can help you.\n\n_remove_\n\nHow many integrations do we get with each account?\n\nStandard plans come with one integration. With our agency, enterprise and custom plans, the number of integrations varies based on your specific needs. If you happen to have multiple Salesforce accounts, or you are an agency and want to connect all your clients CRMs or marketing automation tools, you can get an integration add on by contacting us here or via chat on the bottom right of your page.\n\n_remove_\n\nWhat happens during and after the trial period?\n\nDuring the trial you get access to the business plan for 7 days without needing to add a credit card. After the trial, you can add a card and choose a plan that works for you. Of course, make sure to use the chat on the bottom right of your screen for any questions, we\u2019d love to help!\n\n_remove_\n\nAny cancellation fees?\n\nWe have a simple SaaS based pricing model with monthly and annual plans. Cancellations take place at the end of your committed term.\n\n_remove_\n\nWhat are your billing cycles and payment options?\n\nOur two standard options are monthly or annual, with payments made upfront for the term. For smaller companies or companies that need payment plans, feel free to reach out to using the chat on the bottom right of your screen!\n\n_remove_\n\nCan we purchase lead add ons?\n\nYes if you max out the leads on your plan, you can either upgrade to a higher plan or we can craft a lead add on for you based on your needs.\n\n_remove_\n\nCan you build my calculators, quizzes, recommendations, assessments, chatbots etc for me?\n\nYes, we do have a custom build option and would be happy to help you. If you are interested in a custom build\n\n_remove_\n\nCan I build as many calculators, quizzes, chatbots, recommendation tools as I want on your essentials, business and enterprise plans?\n\nYes, there are so many possibilities and ideas for each of our content types so we have given unlimited content on some of our larger plans.\n\n_remove_\n\nWhich integrations do you have?\n\nWe have many native integrations including: Marketo, Salesforce, Eloqua, Hubspot, Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Slack, Constant Contact, Campaign Monitor, Aweber, Drip, Myemma, Get Response, Unbounce, Listrak, Sendlane, Zoho, Intercom, Facebook messenger, Pardot, Active Campaign, Keap/infusionsoft, Ontraport and many others. We also integrate with over 1000 tools via zapier.\n\n_remove_\n\nIs Outgrow Content accessible?\n\nWe have an accessibility toggle which leverages W3 guidelines of accessibility and allows a user to navigate with just a keyboard, they can understand questions / text using a screen reader, and the colors used will be ADA compliant so they can be seen by someone with color blindness.\n\nGet started with a free trial.
