We enable companies (existing ones or those in the process of being registered) to benefit from a payment account and all the means of payment necessary for the smooth running of their business (physical and virtual cards, direct debits, international transfers, cheque deposits).\n\nAs a regulated payment institution, all our customers\u2019 funds are secured. The funds deposited in your Qonto account are totally separate from Qonto\u2019s treasury.\n\nThe funds are partly \u201csegregated\u201d in the books of Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Ark\u00e9a. The other part is invested in qualified money market funds, the units of which are held in the books of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations.\u00a0This means that no one but you has access to your money. Neither Qonto nor anyone else can use or invest your company\u2019s money.\n\nFor more information please refer to [this article](https://qonto9015.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/23947671909905-how-are-my-funds-protected).\n\nWhether your company is already registered or is in the process of being created, we have **offers adapted to all** to guide you through the different stages of your company's life.\n\nWhether you are alone or in a team, Qonto provides you with all the payment methods you need to manage your business in real time. Qonto offers **metal cards** for professionals and allows the reception of **SWIFT transfers** (from abroad).\n\nMuch more than a current account, Qonto simplifies your daily life with a range of features that make it easier to keep an eye on everyone's expenses and prepare your daily accounting.\n\nSince 2019, we have been using **our own banking platform** (also known as the Core Banking System), which allows us to carry out our clients' transactions ourselves. This independence allows us to offer a smoother experience to our clients and to directly create the products and services that make their day-to-day life easier.\n\nOur mission is focused on the needs of professionals and their expectations. This is why our customer service is **ultra responsive** and **attentive**, with people ready to answer your questions as quickly as possible.\n\nQonto's pricing and offers are **transparent**. All monthly subscriptions come **without commitments**. You can switch from one plan to another at any time if your business needs to change.\n\n500,000 business customers have already joined Qonto to simplify their day-to-day financial management - why not you?\n\nQonto is designed for all professionals and companies who wish to **optimize their daily financial and accounting management**. The opening of a Qonto business current account is currently accessible to companies registered in **France** (SA, SAS, SASU, SARL, SC & SCI, EURL, liberal professions, micro-enterprises). **Italian, Spanish or German companies** also have the possibility to manage their finances on Qonto.\u00a0In France, Qonto also allows registered associations to create an account for professional purposes.\n\nQonto also makes it easier to set up a business by giving future entrepreneurs the opportunity to **open an account** and deposit the **initial share capital** (excluding SCIs and companies domiciled in French overseas departments and territories) required to register and obtain their Kbis and SIREN number.\n\nThere is **no movement commission** in addition to the cost of the subscription.\n\nIn other words, if you do not exceed the transaction volume and services included in your subscription, **you will only be charged for the monthly rate** of your subscription.\n\nIf you order additional cards or make additional transactions (over those included in your subscription), additional fees will be charged. Find all the details on the fees for additional cards and services [here.](https://qonto.com/en/pricing#solo)\n\n**Transfers**\n\nYour Qonto account allows you to receive transfers from all over the world and send money in more than **32\u00a0foreign currencies via the SWIFT network.** This feature is included in some of our plans. Discover all our plans and what they include from our [Pricing page](https://qonto.com/en/pricing#solo).\n\n**Payments by card**\n\nAll of our Qonto cards accompany and insure you when you travel. If you are a frequent traveler, we advise you to order one of our **Plus or X Cards**.\n\nWith the Plus Card you benefit from a low, **1% exchange rate commission** on card payments outside the Euro zone.\n\nWith the X Card, all your payments abroad are made at **the real exchange rate** (without any exchange commission) and your withdrawals are free of charge.\n\nThese two cards come with **premium insurance** to protect you and your teams when travelling.\n\n**SEPA Creditor Identifier creation**\n\nThe SEPA Creditor Identifier (ICS) enables you to debit your customers' accounts via SEPA Direct Debit.\n\n**Confirmation letter**\n\nIt is a regulatory document that companies may need annually in the event of an audit. Please note that Qonto **will not charge you any additional fees** for requesting a confirmation letter.\n\n**Management of irregularities**\n\nQonto will charge you **10%** of the amount requested by the seizing authority, up to **a maximum of \u20ac100 excl. VAT.**\n\nAn irregularity occurs when the tax administration or a creditor through a legal authority demands reimbursement of an unpaid debt. As a payment institution, we are required to take the steps to reimburse your debt: this is what we call a seizure of bank accounts.\n\n**Capital increase (France only)**\n\n\\- Capital increase of less than \u20ac1.2 million with a maximum of 15 shareholders and with the funds coming exclusively from French bank accounts: **\u20ac150 excl. VAT**.\n\n\\- Capital increase of less than \u20ac1.2 million with a maximum of 15 shareholders and with the funds coming, in whole or in part, from bank accounts outside of France: **\u20ac250 excl. VAT**.\n\n\\- Capital increase of between \u20ac1.2 million and \u20ac5 million, and/or with between 15 and 30 shareholders, and/or with the funds coming, in whole or in part, from bank accounts outside of France: **\u20ac300 excl. VAT**.\n\nA capital increase enables the creation of new shares, which can then be purchased by one of the current shareholders or by a new shareholder.\n\nAs a Qonto customer, your subscription fees are collected directly from your Qonto account. You can choose to be billed on either a monthly basis or, alternatively, to pay upfront for a full year by choosing our annual payment option.\n\nNewly-formed companies subscribing to one of our company creators\u2019 plans will make their first payment to Qonto when they register for their plan.\n\nIf your company already existed before you signed up to a Qonto plan, your first payment to Qonto will be due at the end of your 30-day free trial period.\n\nIf you choose to be billed on a monthly basis, your first payment will be calculated according to the number of days remaining in the month in which you registered your Qonto account. Thereafter, your following subscription payments will be billed on the first day of each month. Any additional fees, for example for extra payment cards or operations not included in your plan, will be billed as and when they occur.\n\nIf you choose to pay annually for your Qonto account, the amount of your first payment will be calculated based on the number of days remaining in the month you subscribed to the account + 11 full months (to complete for a full year). After this first annual payment, you will be billed each year for a full yearly fee. Any additional fees, for example for extra payment cards or operations not included in your plan, will be billed as and when they occur.\n\nIn cases where there are insufficient funds in your Qonto account to pay your Qonto subscription, Qonto has made the choice not to apply penalty fees on your overdue payments, as other institutions do. Instead, you will be notified of a \"payment failure\" and will be asked to top up your account so that your payment can be processed next.\n\nAn \u2018Add-on\u2019 is a package of additional features that you can add to your Qonto plan. These paid packages provide you with complementary tools to enhance your experience and allow you to tailor Qonto\u2019s offer to your specific business needs.\n\nIf you pay for your Qonto plan on a monthly basis, the additional fees for an Add-on will also be billed monthly.\n\nIf you pay for your Qonto plan on an annual basis, you can choose to be billed for any Add-ons either monthly or annually.\n\nSee all Qonto account plans and prices. \u2713 From \u20ac9/month. \u2713 Over 500,000 customers.
