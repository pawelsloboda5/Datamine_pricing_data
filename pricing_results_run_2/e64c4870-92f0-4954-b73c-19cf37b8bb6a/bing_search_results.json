Get a custom plan.\n-------------------------------\n\nHaven\u2019t found a plan that covers everything you need? Contact us to discuss a custom plan.\n\nContact us\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### Can I cancel my subscription anytime?\n\nYes, you can cancel your subscription, downgrade or upgrade your plan at any time.\n\n### What is Semrush\u2019s refund policy?\n\nYou get a 7-day money-back guarantee on all plans. Submit your request via our [contact form](https://www.semrush.com/kb/support), and we will refund the payment made if the request is made within 7 days after the sign-up.\n\n### What payment methods do you accept?\n\nYou can pay using the following payment methods:\n\n*   All major credit cards including Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, and UnionPay\n*   Wire transfer (upon request)\n*   Check or money order (US only, upon request)\n\n### Do I get a customer demo?\n\nOnce you sign up for a Semrush free trial, request a free training session [here](https://www.semrush.com/company/request-demo). After your demo, you will be assigned a dedicated point of contact for all of your Semrush-related questions.\n\n### Can I use Semrush for free?\n\nYes. With a free account, you can still use a lot of tools, but you will be limited in your ability to pull all of the data and use other tools. The maximum number of requests made to the Analytics reports per day is limited to only 10 (Pro users have access to 3,000 searches, Guru \u2014 5,000 searches, Business \u2014 10,000 searches). As a free user, you can create and manage only one Project and track 10 keywords in Position Tracking. Discover more features we offer our free users and the comparison to our paid plans in [this article](https://www.semrush.com/blog/what-can-i-do-with-a-free-account-from-semrush).\n\n### Am I charged when I enter my credit card?\n\nWe will charge a nominal amount to your credit card to check its validity; once confirmed, it will be immediately refunded. Until your Semrush trial period ends you won\u2019t be charged.\n\n### Which would be better for me, Guru or Pro?\n\nIf you\u2019re a freelancer, blogger, or in-house marketer with a limited budget, then the Semrush Pro plan will likely be the best option. If you\u2019re a professional SEO consultant or an agency with numerous clients, then you will be best suited to the Semrush Guru plan.\n\nYou can find a deep comparison of our plans by limits in the [subscription limits](https://www.semrush.com/kb/856-subscription-plans-comparison) article.\n\n### I run a small agency. What plan should I choose?\n\nYou might choose Pro plan, which is the basic subscription, or Guru plan, which is the most popular for SMBs and growing agencies. The plans differ in the number of tools available as well as in the number of limits.\n\nYou can consult [this page](https://www.semrush.com/kb/1011-subscriptions) to understand better which subscription will better fit your marketing needs.\n\n### What is the pricing currency?\n\nAll prices are in US dollars.\n\nTestimonials\n------------\n\n1 / 5\n\nIn the first 5 years of RockContent's existence Semrush has helped us to become Brazil's biggest digital marketing blog.\n\nVitor Pe\u00e7anha\n\nCo-Founder, Rock Content\n\nBy using Semrush, my team saves a lot of time by working on the right content and in a more data-driven way. Everything we do here is backed up with data, and your tool is giving us more ammunition.\n\nIdan Segal\n\nOrganic Growth Lead, Wix\n\nThe most important thing I can have really is data. Data is my currency. I need to support initiatives, business cases - any tools that give me insight I find incredibly useful. Semrush is a very solid package that delivers exactly that.\n\nNick Wilsdon\n\nProduct Owner, Search, Vodafone Group\n\nEncouraged by our successes with Semrush software, I was asked to rollout Semrush to the rest of the university including all the faculties. With the help of Semrush, we empowered every single marketing team within the university to do what was done for the central sites.\n\nShefali Joshi\n\nMarketing Optimization Analyst, Monash University\n\nThe competition is really tough.

Get a custom plan.\n-------------------------------\n\nHaven\u2019t found a plan that covers everything you need? Contact us to discuss a custom plan.\n\nContact us\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### Can I cancel my subscription anytime?\n\nYes, you can cancel your subscription, downgrade or upgrade your plan at any time.\n\n### What is Semrush\u2019s refund policy?\n\nYou get a 7-day money-back guarantee on all plans. Submit your request via our [contact form](https://www.semrush.com/kb/support), and we will refund the payment made if the request is made within 7 days after the sign-up.\n\n### What payment methods do you accept?\n\nYou can pay using the following payment methods:\n\n*   All major credit cards including Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, and UnionPay\n*   Wire transfer (upon request)\n*   Check or money order (US only, upon request)\n\n### Do I get a customer demo?\n\nOnce you sign up for a Semrush free trial, request a free training session [here](https://www.semrush.com/company/request-demo). After your demo, you will be assigned a dedicated point of contact for all of your Semrush-related questions.\n\n### Can I use Semrush for free?\n\nYes. With a free account, you can still use a lot of tools, but you will be limited in your ability to pull all of the data and use other tools. The maximum number of requests made to the Analytics reports per day is limited to only 10 (Pro users have access to 3,000 searches, Guru \u2014 5,000 searches, Business \u2014 10,000 searches). As a free user, you can create and manage only one Project and track 10 keywords in Position Tracking.

Until your Semrush trial period ends you won\u2019t be charged.\n\n### Which would be better for me, Guru or Pro?\n\nIf you\u2019re a freelancer, blogger, or in-house marketer with a limited budget, then the Semrush Pro plan will likely be the best option. If you\u2019re a professional SEO consultant or an agency with numerous clients, then you will be best suited to the Semrush Guru plan.\n\nYou can find a deep comparison of our plans by limits in the [subscription limits](https://www.semrush.com/kb/856-subscription-plans-comparison) article.\n\n### I run a small agency. What plan should I choose?\n\nYou might choose Pro plan, which is the basic subscription, or Guru plan, which is the most popular for SMBs and growing agencies. The plans differ in the number of tools available as well as in the number of limits.\n\nYou can consult [this page](https://www.semrush.com/kb/1011-subscriptions) to understand better which subscription will better fit your marketing needs.\n\n### What is the pricing currency?\n\nAll prices are in US dollars.\n\nTestimonials\n------------\n\n1 / 5\n\nIn the first 5 years of RockContent's existence Semrush has helped us to become Brazil's biggest digital marketing blog.\n\nVitor Pe\u00e7anha\n\nCo-Founder, Rock Content\n\nBy using Semrush, my team saves a lot of time by working on the right content and in a more data-driven way.

Data is my currency. I need to support initiatives, business cases - any tools that give me insight I find incredibly useful. Semrush is a very solid package that delivers exactly that.\n\nNick Wilsdon\n\nProduct Owner, Search, Vodafone Group\n\nEncouraged by our successes with Semrush software, I was asked to rollout Semrush to the rest of the university including all the faculties. With the help of Semrush, we empowered every single marketing team within the university to do what was done for the central sites.\n\nShefali Joshi\n\nMarketing Optimization Analyst, Monash University\n\nThe competition is really tough. It\u2019s getting harder to compete for the top 3 positions when it comes to the most popular KWs. You have to really deep dive into keyword research to find those untapped opportunities.
