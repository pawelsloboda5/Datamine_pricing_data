Agents can:\n\n*   View the portal, queues, reports, and SLA metrics within a service project\n    \n*   View, add, edit, and delete customer-facing and internal comments on issues\n    \n*   Add customers to a service project\n    \n*   View, create, and manage content in the knowledge base\n    \n*   Manage customers and organizations\n    \n\nJira users who aren\u2019t licensed as agents in JSM will still be able to perform some actions in a ticket, like:\n\n*   Helping diagnose issues through internal comments with agents\n    \n*   Watching tickets and receive notifications for updates\n    \n\nA **customer** is anyone who creates requests through the customer portal or by email. Customers can:\n\n*   Create, comment on, and track requests through the customer portal\n    \n*   Create and comment on requests via email\n    \n*   Add comments and attachment to requests\n    \n*   Add other participants to their own requests\n    \n\n### About licenses and billing by user type\n\nFor **monthly** subscriptions, we\u2019ll charge you for the following month\u2019s subscription based on the exact number of Jira Service Management users you have. Add and remove agents as your team changes.\n\nFor **annual** subscriptions, we\u2019ll charge you for the tier that most closely matches your user count. Depending on the number of users purchased, annual subscriptions may be a better value.\n\nSee monthly and annual tiers for our [Standard](https://wac-web.stg-east.frontend.public.atl-paas.net/licensing/jira-service-management#How-much-does-a-Jira-Service-Management-Cloud-Standard-subscription-cost) or [Premium](https://wac-web.stg-east.frontend.public.atl-paas.net/licensing/jira-service-management#How-much-does-a-Jira-Service-Management-Cloud-Premium-subscription-cost) plan.\n\n**Customers are free** and don\u2019t require a JSM license. Anyone can create a service request, and you'll never be limited to how many customers can access JSM.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have the same number of Jira Software and JSM licenses. You can select and pay for what you need with each product.\n\nStill have questions on how roles and licensing work?

Above this limit, assisted conversations **will start at $0.30(USD)/assisted conversation/month with** [**volume discounts**](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/future-pricing/cloud-pricing/pricing-tables#jsm-consumption-based-pricing-volume-discounts)**.**\n\n**What is considered a virtual service agent assisted conversation?**\n\nAssisted conversations include:\n\n*   **Matched** conversations \u2013 any conversation that was matched to an intent, regardless of whether the virtual service agent resolves the issue or escalates it to an agent for further support. [Read more about how intent matching works](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/about-standard-flows/).\n    \n*   **AI resolved** conversations \u2013 any conversation during which the virtual service agent responds to the customer using Atlassian Intelligence answers, and the customer indicates that the response resolved their issue or abandons the conversation, resulting in the conversation being auto-closed.\n    \n\n[How feature usage works in Jira Service Management](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/what-is-feature-usage-and-how-it-works/)\n\n**How do I add more virtual service agent assisted conversations?**\n\nTo get extra assisted conversations for the virtual service agent on your site, first you\u2019ll need to subscribe to the \u2018Extra assisted conversations\u2019 add-on (you\u2019ll need billing admin permissions):\n\n*   Go to [admin.atlassian.com](https://admin.atlassian.com/billing) and select **Billing**.\n    \n*   Find **Jira Service Management** in the list and select **Manage**.\n    \n*   On the **Subscriptions details** page, select the **Add-ons** tab.\n    \n*   If you haven\u2019t subscribed to an add-on before, select **Explore add-ons**.\n    \n*   Otherwise, select **Get add-on** under the Extra objects card.\n    \n*   Follow the steps to subscribe to **Extra assisted conversations**.\n    \n*   If you pay monthly, you can then select **Increase usage limit** and follow the steps to raise your limit.\n    \n*   If you pay annually, you can pre-purchase your **Extra assisted conversations** as tiers \u2013 the amount you purchase will become your limit.\n    \n\nOnce you\u2019ve subscribed to the add-on, you can change your limit at any time:\n\n*   From your service project, go to the top right of your screen and select **Settings \\> Products**.\n    \n*   Under **Jira Service Management**, select **Feature usage**.\n    \n*   View the **virtual service agent** tab and select **Change limit**.\n    \n\nIf you can\u2019t subscribe to \u2018**Extra assisted conversations**\u2019 or can\u2019t see where to manage limits, [check this article](https://support.atlassian.com/subscriptions-and-billing/docs/understand-the-improved-atlassian-billing-experience/).\n\n![Image 5: Quotation right](https://wac-cdn-bfldr.atlassian.com/K3MHR9G8/at/vnxrbnhb59wvckf5wx3bx95/symbol_speech_bubble_3.svg?auto=webp&format=png?auto=webp)\n\n### Questions?\n\nWe have answers.
