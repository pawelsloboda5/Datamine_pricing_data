This proactive approach gives you time to fully understand your alternatives, review platform costs and to make well-informed decisions without feeling rushed.\n\nFeefo reviews are built on trust, featuring genuine insights from authentic customers, who have actually used the products and services. We send feedback requests directly to real customers that have made a purchase from you, to guarantee that all reviews are genuine.\n\nThis process not only protects your business from fake reviews but also helps build trust with potential buyers. Authentic feedback can boost sales, enhance your reputation, and reinforce your brand as one people can rely on, with reviews they know are trustworthy.\n\nAll our plans include comprehensive customer support from real humans through phone, email, and live chat, ensuring that help is always available when you need it.\n\nFor businesses that require more personalised assistance, our Enhanced and Enterprise packages offer the option of a dedicated account manager to provide tailored support and guidance.\n\nWhether you\u2019re on a basic plan or a premium package, you can count on reliable and accessible customer service from the Feefo team.\n\nOur standard contract duration is 12 months, providing you with long-term stability and commitment. We believe in flexibility, which is why we provide the convenience of monthly payments, so you can manage your budget effectively.\n\nThis payment structure ensures transparency and allows you to focus on growing your business without worrying about your review platform costs. Choose a plan that supports your goals with the peace of mind that comes from a stable, flexible contract.\n\nYes, you can add multiple websites to your package. While pricing is generally based on a per-domain model, we're open to discuss options as you add more domains. Reach out to us, and we\u2019ll be happy to create a tailored solution that fits your specific needs.\n\nNo, we don\u2019t charge additional fees for setup. They\u2019re included with your subscription costs.\n\nDiscover pricing for Feefo verified customer reviews platform. Flexible pricing to suit your business.",
