To facilitate this, our nonprofit members have access to a shared transparent feedback tool through which they make requests and upvote others\u2019 suggestions, as well as gauge our progress on projects we undertake.\n\n### Our commitment to nonprofits goes beyond fundraising\n\nWe support values that inspire nonprofits to tackle tough challenges and complex issues such as gender and racial equality, reproductive health and LGBTQ+ rights, social and environmental justice, education, domestic violence, immigrant services and more.\n\nIn keeping with that, we personally review every membership application to ensure each nonprofit member aligns with our values. We also work to terminate all uses of our technology that promote activities not in alignment with our values\n\nNotably, we believe that #BlackLivesMatter and stand in solidarity with Asian Americans.\n\nLearn more about [the values we hold dear](https://www.givelively.org/values).\n\nHow and why is Give Lively\u2019s platform free for nonprofits?\n\nWe believe that nonprofits, no matter their size, should not sacrifice their means to satisfy their missions.

In Give Lively, they identified a mechanism for sustainably leveraging their resources to help meet the development needs of a very broad group of potential beneficiaries.\n\nThat mechanism is our superpower.
