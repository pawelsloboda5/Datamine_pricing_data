Cancel anytime.\n\n[Start my free trial](https://unbounce.com/pricing/#start-btn)\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n#### How does the free 14-day trial work?\n\nYour free 14-day trial on a Build, Experiment, or Optimize plan gives you full access to all of the corresponding plan features. There are no restrictions, and you won\u2019t be billed until after your 14-day trial is complete.\n\nWe\u2019ll send you a reminder email near the end of your Build, Experiment, or Optimize trial to verify that you want to continue using Unbounce. If you want to cancel, you can do so at any time by logging into your Unbounce account, going to \u201cAccount Management\u201d, selecting \u201cSubscriptions\u201d, and clicking \u201cCancel\u201d.\n\n#### Why do you need my credit card for the free trial?\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked to provide your credit card information when you sign up for a free 14-day trial with our Build, Experiment, or Optimize plans. This ensures that\u2014in the event you decide to continue using Unbounce beyond the 14-day trial period\u2014there are no interruptions to your subscription.\n\nYou can also try Unbounce\u2019s [interactive demo](https://preview.unbounce.com/?_gl=1*163atml*_gcl_au*NTI4MDYwODA5LjE3NDIyODI5OTY.*_ga*NTg5Mzk4MjU3LjE3NDIyODI5OTY.*_ga_8GFBJRYYE1*MTc0MjI5MDMzNC44NC4xLjE3NDIyOTI4NTAuMC4wLjA.&_ga=2.133229900.396126974.1742282996-589398257.1742282996) without providing your credit card information.\n\n#### Can I change my plan?\n\nYou can change from a Build, Experiment, or Optimize plan by logging into your Unbounce account, going to \u201cAccount Management\u201d, and selecting \u201cSubscriptions\u201d. You can upgrade to a higher-tier plan at any time, but switching to a lower-tier plan will only take effect at the end of your current billing cycle (monthly or annually).\n\n#### How does hosting work? Can I connect my own domain?\n\nOur Build, Experiment, and Optimize plans all include free hosting through Unbounce. You can also publish your landing pages directly to your own domain or WordPress website (in which case you\u2019ll be responsible for hosting).\n\n#### What counts as a conversion? What counts as a visitor?\n\nWe log a **conversion** when someone completes your assigned conversion goal on a landing page or in a popup or sticky bar. Common conversion goals include clicking a call to action button or submitting a form.\n\nA **visitor** is a person who views your landing page, popup, or sticky bar at least once in a given month. Using cookies, we ensure each visitor only counts once toward your limit\u2014no matter how many times they return.\n\n#### What happens if I exceed my conversion or traffic limits?\n\nIf it looks like you\u2019re at risk of exceeding your conversion or traffic limits, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know by email and through in-app messages. In the event that you go over your limit, we\u2019ll automatically upgrade you to a plan with higher limits for the next billing cycle (monthly or annual).

You can learn more about these services [here](https://unbounce.com/professional-services-add-ons/).\n\n#### Is Unbounce GDPR compliant?\n\nBusinesses are responsible for including GDPR (and/or CASL) compliance in their marketing strategy. The best way to ensure GDPR compliance is to consult with legal counsel.\n\nUnbounce can help you align with GDPR best practices through functionality you can apply to your campaigns. For example, using our landing page builder, you can easily add checkbox fields to your forms that allow visitors to consent to your privacy and data storage practices.\n\n*   Product\n    *   [Landing pages](https://unbounce.com/product/landing-pages/)\n    *   [Integrations](https://unbounce.com/product/integrations/)\n    *   [Features](https://unbounce.com/product/features/)\n    *   [Landing page templates](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-templates/)\n    *   [How we compare](https://unbounce.com/comparisons/)\n    *   [Product security](https://unbounce.com/product/security/)\n*   Solutions\n    *   [Agencies](https://unbounce.com/solutions/industry/agencies/)\n    *   [Ecommerce](https://unbounce.com/solutions/industry/ecommerce/)\n    *   [SaaS](https://unbounce.com/solutions/industry/saas/)\n    *   [Small businesses](https://unbounce.com/solutions/industry/small-businesses/)\n    *   [B2B marketing](https://unbounce.com/solutions/industry/b2b-segment/)\n    *   [Service specialists](https://unbounce.com/solutions/industry/professional-services/)\n*   Company\n    *   [Corporate](https://unbounce.com/go-to-market-solutions/)\n    *   [About us](https://unbounce.com/about/)\n    *   [Careers](https://unbounce.com/careers/)\n    *   [Partners](https://unbounce.com/partner-program/)\n*   [Resources](https://unbounce.com/resources/)\n    *   [Blog](https://unbounce.com/blog/)\n    *   [Integrate with us](https://developer.unbounce.com/)\n    *   [How to build a landing page](https://unbounce.com/how-to-create-a-landing-page/)\n    *   [Landing page basics](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/)\n    *   [Landing page examples](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples-built-with-unbounce/)\n*   Get in touch\n    *   [Contact](https://unbounce.com/contact-us/)\n    *   [Help center](https://documentation.unbounce.com/)\n    *   [Professional services](https://unbounce.com/professional-services-add-ons/)\n\n[![Image 290: unbounce](blob:http://localhost/4ef68ad3ab32a55bc058f7ada5e92d25)](https://unbounce.com/)\n\n[![Image 292: unbounce](blob:http://localhost/4ef68ad3ab32a55bc058f7ada5e92d25)](https://unbounce.com/)\n\n\u00a9 2009\u20132025 Unbounce Inc.
