After starting my free trial, I immediately fell in love with how easy to use their interface was.

If we notice that you\u2019re consistently going over your download limit we\u2019ll reach out to you and get you to upgrade to the next level. There's no \"automatic shut off;\" we'll continue to serve audio for your listeners.\n\n#### How many podcasts can I\u00a0have?\n\nWith Transistor, you have the flexibility to [host an unlimited number of podcasts](https://transistor.fm/features/host-multiple-podcasts-on-the-same-account/) using a single account. Regardless of your subscription plan, you can create and manage multiple podcasts.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the number of episodes you can have within each podcast, and you won't encounter any storage limits. Each podcast you create on Transistor gets its own RSS feed, podcast website, and analytics page. Enjoy the freedom to explore and produce as many podcasts as you desire!\n\n#### Do I own my content on\u00a0Transistor?\n\nYes! You retain ownership over all your content on Transistor.\n\nIn our\u00a0[terms](https://transistor.fm/terms/), you are simply giving us permission to host and distribute your content. Aside from this permission, Transistor doesn't acquire any\u00a0right, title, or interest in or to your content.\n\nFurthermore, you can do whatever you'd like with your show: run your own ads, create a Patreon membership, and distribute it any way you'd like.\n\n#### How do I make a\u00a0podcast?\n\n1.  Get a [USB microphone](https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast#bestmic) (the ATR2100 or the Samson Q2U are both good).\n    \n2.  Connect your microphone to your computer, iPhone, Android, or tablet.\n    \n3.  [Record your audio](https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast#bestsoftware).\u00a0You can use free software like Garage Band (Mac) or Audacity (PC).\n    \n4.  Export your recorded audio to MP3. For audio quality, choose 44100 Hz and 128 kb/s in your export settings.\n    \n5.  Log in to your [Transistor hosting](https://dashboard.transistor.fm/)\u00a0account.\n    \n6.  Upload the MP3 file you recorded, and then publish your episode.\n    \n7.  Now, your hosting provider will generate an [RSS feed](https://transistor.fm/podcast-hosting) for your podcast.\n    \n8.  [Submit your podcast's RSS feed](https://help.transistor.fm/section/3-submitting-to-itunes-spotify-and-other-directories)\u00a0to Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n    \n9.  Every time you publish a new episode, listeners will automatically get it in their podcast player!\n    \n\nFor more information, please read our guide: [How to start a podcast](https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast/).\n\n#### Is there a limit to the hours/size of a podcast that can be hosted on\u00a0Transistor?\n\nWe don't limit the number of episodes you can upload or the amount of total storage on Transistor. Individual audio files can be up to 1000MB, which in mp3 format is many hours of audio. Our pricing plans are based on the number of [monthly downloads](https://support.transistor.fm/en/article/what-constitutes-a-podcast-download-stream-listen-kv1em2/) you get. You can also [start as many separate podcasts](https://transistor.fm/features/host-multiple-podcasts-on-the-same-account/) as you'd like!\n\n[#### Over 20,000 podcasts are hosted on Transistor Our podcast hosting platform just hit a new milestone: we now have over 20,000 podcast feeds on Transistor. #### Transistor Team May 11, 2022 1 min](https://transistor.fm/20k/)[#### What is a video podcast?
