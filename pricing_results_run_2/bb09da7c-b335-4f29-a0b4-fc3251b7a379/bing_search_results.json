Once your account is approved, you can try all the features of the Hobby plan and send up to 100 emails per month with a Trial plan. You\u2019ll also receive a free trial domain to send up to 100 emails to test out MailerSend before adding a domain.\u00a0\n\nIf you wish to send more emails, and enjoy the full MailerSend experience, you can upgrade to a Starter or Professional plan and get 50,000 emails per month.\n\nWhat are the advantages of using the trial domain?\n\nAdding and verifying your domain involves adding some authentication records to your DNS. If you\u2019re trialing numerous email delivery tools, this can become time-consuming and inconvenient. With the trial domain, you can test out MailerSend to its full potential without adding your own domain, only doing so if you decide it\u2019s the tool for you.\n\nHow does the free plan work?\n\nOnce your account is approved, you can subscribe to a Hobby plan. This plan lets you send up to 3,000 emails per month for free!\n\nSimply go to the Plan and billing page and enter your organization\u2019s address and credit card information to complete your subscription. The billing period starts right after you enter your credit card details.\n\nIf you send more than 3,000 emails per month, the cost of additional emails is $1.00 per 1,000 emails. The number of emails that you have sent automatically resets every 30 days.\n\nHow does the Starter / Professional plan work?\n\nOnce your account is approved, you can pick a Starter or Professional plan to match the number of emails that you send every month. Save money as you send more emails!\n\nIn addition to all the features of the Hobby plan, you also enjoy multiple sending domains, templates, file uploads, webhooks and API tokens, plus 30 days of log retention (Professional), and live chat support.\n\nSubscribe to a Starter or Professional plan by choosing a monthly plan on the Plan and billing page. Then enter your organization\u2019s details and credit card information to complete your purchase.\n\nIf you exceed the monthly quota of your plan, don\u2019t worry\u2014you can continue sending emails without disruption. These will be charged at an additional low cost per 1,000 emails (applies to all plans). The number of emails that you have sent automatically resets every 30 days.\n\nWhat if I decide to cancel?\n\nIf you no longer wish to use MailerSend, you may cancel at any time. Your subscription will remain active for the remainder of that month's billing cycle, at the end of which you will receive a final charge for any additional emails sent outside of your current plan\u2019s allowance.\n\nCan I use MailerSend with multiple users?\n\nYes! Both the Hobby and Starter plans include up to 5 users while Professional and Enterprise plans offer unlimited user seats. What's more, you can assign each user a role or give them custom access permissions.\n\nWhat is the trial domain?\n\nThe trial domain is a free domain you can use to conveniently test out MailerSend before adding and verifying your own domain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the trial domain?\n\nThere is a limit of 100 emails for the trial domain.\n\nWhy do you need my credit card details for the Hobby plan?\n\nAs you start increasing your email volume with MailerSend, you might exceed the quota of 3,000 free emails per month included in the Hobby plan. As additional emails cost $1.00 per 1,000 emails, a payment method is required. Additional emails will be billed during the next billing period.\n\nCan I change my plan later?\n\nYou can change your plan at any time! When you upgrade your plan, changes are applied immediately. When you downgrade your plan, changes are applied at the end of your current billing cycle.\n\nWhat are extra emails?\n\nMailerSend ensures you can keep sending emails if you reach your monthly subscription quota. For example, an $68 subscription includes 100,000 emails on the Starter plan. Any extra email sent above that allowance has a cost of $0.90 for a block of 1,000 emails.\n\nWhat if I hit a limit on my free plan?\n\nOur free plan has a few limits per account: 3 templates, 1 domain, 5 users, 3 API tokens and 1 webhook. To increase your limits, and have the full MailerSend experience, you will need to upgrade to a Starter or Professional plan.\n\nPRODUCT\nTransactional emails\nTransactional SMS\nEmail API\nEmail templates\nEmail delivery\nSMTP relay\nInbound email routing\nRoadmap\nRESOURCES\nAPI reference\nStatus\nIntegrations\nKnowledge base\nBrand assets\nFree templates\nBlog\nCOMPANY\nAbout us\nPricing\nJobs\nContact us\nAffiliate program\nCompare\nNewsroom\nLet\u2019s keep in touch\n\nSign up for our monthly newsletter and MailerSend updates.\n\nSorry, but you look like a robot.\n\u00a9 2020 - 2025 MailerSend.\nTerms of Service Privacy Policy Report Abuse Cookies Settings\nGDPR Compliant\nYour data is safe with us\n\nStraightforward and fair pricing is always our goal.
