Almost all of our products are available for purchase individually and are also available as add-ons to enhance your selected suite.\n\n### Can I purchase additional subscriptions of a specific product in a suite?\n\nIn most cases, no. Suites are designed to have a uniform quantity of subscriptions across all the products within a suite. To increase the number of subscriptions for a specific product in a suite, you must purchase additional subscriptions of the suite itself. There are exceptions for Workflows, Privileged Access, and Machine-to-Machine Tokens.\n\n### Are there minimum or maximum subscription requirements for any of the suites?\n\nNo, provided you meet the $1,500 annual contract minimum.\n\n### Are comprehensive support services available for purchase?\n\nYes. [Okta Premier Success Plans](https://www.okta.com/services/success-and-support/#premier) align with the complexity of your environment and provide the expertise and support you need from the right people, at the right time.\n\nAll Okta customers get access to [introductory training and online support](https://www.okta.com/services/success-and-support/) available 24 hours per day, five days per week.\n\n### What are Okta Privileged Access Resource Units?\n\nOkta Privileged Access usage is based on Resource Units, which you can acquire as part of a suite or purchase individually. With an entitlement to a pool of Resource Units, you can secure supported privileged Resource types, including Users and Servers.\n\nThe Essentials Suite includes 1 Resource Unit, while the Professional and Enterprise suites entitle you to the number of Resource Units equal to 50% of the total suite subscriptions purchased.\n\n### What if I already have an access management solution?\n\nOkta Identity Governance (which includes Lifecycle Management, Access Governance, and Workflows) provides access to core Identity management products without requiring you to replace existing SSO or MFA solutions.\n\n### Can I purchase a suite on a month-to-month basis instead of annually?\n\nNo. All of our suites require an annual contract.\n\n### Where can I find additional information about products and resources?\n\nBrowse our ever-growing collection of [on-demand webinars](https://www.okta.com/resources/content-library/?field_resource_solutions_target_id=All&type=webinar) and [datasheets](https://www.okta.com/resources/content-library/?field_resource_solutions_target_id=All&type=datasheet).
