By selecting annual billing, you\u2019ll receive a 20% discount. You can switch between monthly and annual billing at any time. If you switch billing frequencies, any necessary prorations or refunds will be automatically applied.\n\n### What payment methods does Buffer accept?\n\nWe accept credit and debit card payments from Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JCB, Discover, and Diners Club. Unfortunately, we cannot accept PayPal, checks, or bank transfers at this time. [Learn more about our accepted payment methods](https://support.buffer.com/article/537-accepted-payment-methods?utm_source=marketing-site&utm_medium=help-center&utm_campaign=help-center).\n\n### Does Buffer have a free trial?\n\nYes, we offer a 14-day free trial for our Essentials and Team plans. During the trial, you can upgrade to a paid plan or switch to our Free plan at any time. You can also start using Buffer for free right away by signing up for our Free plan without needing a trial period.\n\n### What happens at the end of the 14-day trial?\n\nIf you decide to continue with a subscription after your trial, simply enter your payment details under the \"Billing Method\" section in your account settings. If you don\u2019t wish to upgrade and haven\u2019t entered your payment details, your account will automatically be downgraded to the Free plan.\n\nAny scheduled posts will still be published after the trial ends, provided the connected social channels are not locked. Channels will be locked if you exceed the three-channel limit for the Free plan.\n\n### Can I keep my three free channels if I upgrade from Buffer\u2019s Free plan to a paid plan?\n\nIf you decide to upgrade to a paid plan, you will pay for each channel \u2014 including any channels you had while on the Free plan. This is because paid plans offer unlimited usage and advanced features for all channels you\u2019ve connected to Buffer.\n\n### What is the scheduled post limit for each plan?\n\nThe Free plan allows 10 scheduled posts per channel. Once a post is published, the slot becomes available again, up to the 10-post maximum per channel.\n\nFor the Essentials and Team plans, you have unlimited scheduled posts per channel. Unlimited scheduling is subject to our fair use policy, which caps usage to 5000 posts per channel. We describe this as \u201cunlimited\u201d because no one has ever exceeded this cap.\n\n### Does Buffer offer a discount to non-profit organizations and charities?\n\nYes, Buffer proudly offers a 50% discount on paid plans for nonprofit and charity organizations. [Learn more about our nonprofit discount](https://support.buffer.com/article/536-nonprofit-discount?utm_source=marketing-site&utm_medium=help-center&utm_campaign=help-center).\n\n### Does Buffer charge Value-Added Tax (VAT) to customers?\n\nBuffer applies the local standard Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate for B2C customer located in the United Kingdom. B2B customers may be eligible for VAT exclusion through reverse charge. You can enter your VAT number to have VAT excluded from your invoice.
