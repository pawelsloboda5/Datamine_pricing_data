That request will be counted as 1 credit. We sometimes use the term \u201ccredits\u201d to talk about requests \u2013 1 request and 1 credit are the same thing. For example, if an employee within an onboarding process has to sign 3 separate documents, they can all be sent through a single shipment, both to the employee and to the legal representative. This would be counted as 1 credit.\n\nWhat is a user?\n\nThe person who signs up with Signaturit to send documents for signing through our platform. With the Business+ plan, you can create work teams with several users.\n\nAre electronic signatures legal?\n\nYes. The governing body for electronic signatures in the European Union is eIDAS (EU Regulation 910/2014). At Signaturit, we comply with the eIDAS and our company is recognised as a qualified electronic trust service provider by the Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation. We also have the EU seal of trust.\n\nHow many shipments are used up in one submission?\n\nIn a signature request you can add up to 15 documents to be signed for a single signature credit. If there are multiple signers on the same set of documents, we also count a single signature credit from both the Dashboard and the API.\n\nDo the signatories have to be registered in order to sign?\n\nNo. The signatory receives an email containing a link that they simply need to click on to access and sign the document. This can be done from a computer, tablet, or mobile device.\n\nWhat is the difference between simple and advanced signatures?\n\nSimple signatures are usually employed by checking a box or entering a PIN or OTP code to request a signature on a document. For example, to accept the terms and conditions on a website. This signature cannot uniquely identify the signer. Advanced electronic signatures do allow for the signer to be uniquely identified. At Signaturit, we offer two types of advanced signatures: biometrics (written signatures) and signatures with digital certificates issued by third parties. Both types of signatures are legal, but advanced signatures offer greater legal guarantees than simple signatures, because they can uniquely identify the signer.\n\nHow many documents can I send to be signed?\n\nIt depends on the plan you choose. The Business plan includes 60 documents per year, the Business + plan includes 240 documents per year, and the Enterprise plan includes an unlimited number of documents.\n\nWhat is the process if more than one person needs to sign a document?\n\nThe second signatory will only receive the document to be signed after the first has completed the process. If there is a third signatory, they will receive it after the second has signed. And so on. The order of the signatories is established in the submission process.\n\nCan I change my plan?\n\nYes, you can switch plans easily in your management portal, at any time you choose.\n\nWhat is a batch submission?\n\nThis feature allows you to send a document to many people at the same time. Each signatory will receive the document to sign in their email.\n\nReady to try us?\n----------------\n\n[Contact sales](https://www.signaturit.com/contact/)\n\nSign up to our newsletter\n\nEmail\\*\n\n*   I accept that my personal data will be processed to send the newsletter in accordance with the **[Signaturit Privacy Policy.](https://www.signaturit.com/privacy-policy/)**\\*\n\nLast Acquisition Campaign ID\n\nLast Acquisition Form\n\nFuente del lead\n\nLast Acquisition Content\n\nLast Acquisition Referral\n\nLast Acquisition Source\n\nLast Acquisition Medium\n\nLast Acquisition Campaign\n\nLast Acquisition Term\n\n*   col\n    \n    *   Signaturit Group\n        \n        *   [About Us](https://www.signaturit.com/about-us/)\n        *   [Press](https://www.signaturit.com/press/)\n        *   [Join The Team](https://www.signaturit.com/careers/)\n        *   [Signaturit Solutions](https://www.signaturit.com/certification-authority/)\n        *   [Our Group](https://www.signaturit.com/why-signaturit/our-group/)\n*   col\n    \n    *   Resources Center\n        \n        *   [Resources](https://www.signaturit.com/resources/)\n        *   [Customer Success Stories](https://www.signaturit.com/why-signaturit/success-stories/)\n        *   [ROI Calculator](https://www.signaturit.com/roi-esignature/)\n        *   [Documentation Hub](https://www.signaturit.com/documentation-hub/)\n*   col\n    \n    *   Partners\n        \n        *   [The Technology Alliances](https://www.signaturit.com/alliances/)\n        *   [Consulting Firms](https://www.signaturit.com/consulting-firms/)\n        *   [The Integrators](https://www.signaturit.com/integrators/)\n        *   [The Resellers](https://www.signaturit.com/resellers/)\n        *   [Our Partner Program](https://www.signaturit.com/our-partner-program/)\n*   col\n    \n    *   Legal\n        \n        *   [Compliance \u2013 Accreditations](https://www.signaturit.com/why-signaturit/our-accreditations/)\n        *   [TSP Documents \u2013 Universign](https://www.universign.com/fr/certifications/?__hstc=77344330.f7efa5816e55a7e3c92d9b1408002961.1744721637548.1744721637548.1744721637548.1&__hssc=77344330.1.1744721637548&__hsfp=608284045)\n        *   [TSP Documents \u2013 Signaturit](https://www.signaturit.com/certification-authority/)\n        *   [TSP Documents \u2013 Ivnosys](https://policy.ivsign.net/)\n        *   [TSP Documents \u2013 Vialink](https://app.vialink.fr/tsp/public/?__hstc=77344330.f7efa5816e55a7e3c92d9b1408002961.1744721637548.1744721637548.1744721637548.1&__hssc=77344330.1.1744721637548&__hsfp=608284045#/public/trust-chain)\n*   col\n    \n    *   Developers\n        \n        *   [Salesforce](https://www.signaturit.com/marketplace/salesforce/)\n        *   [Zapier](https://www.signaturit.com/marketplace/zapier/)\n        *   [Google Docs](https://www.signaturit.com/marketplace/google-docs/)\n        *   [SAP](https://www.signaturit.com/)\n        *   [Lucca](https://www.signaturit.com/marketplace/poplee-core-hr-lucca/)\n        *   [Signaturit API](https://www.signaturit.com/products/integrations/api/)\n*   col\n    \n    *   Contact\n        \n        *   [Support](https://signaturit-france.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new)\n        *   [Sales](https://www.signaturit.com/contact/)\n    *   Terms & Conditions\n        \n        *   [T&C Ivnosys](https://ivnosys.com/en/terms-and-conditions/?__hstc=77344330.f7efa5816e55a7e3c92d9b1408002961.1744721637548.1744721637548.1744721637548.1&__hssc=77344330.1.1744721637548&__hsfp=608284045)\n        *   [T&C Signaturit Solutions](https://www.signaturit.com/terms-conditions-signaturit/)\n        *   [T&C Universign](https://www.universign.com/en/terms-and-conditions/?__hstc=77344330.f7efa5816e55a7e3c92d9b1408002961.1744721637548.1744721637548.1744721637548.1&__hssc=77344330.1.1744721637548&__hsfp=608284045)\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/signaturit)[](https://www.instagram.com/signaturit_team/)[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/signaturit/)[](https://www.youtube.com/c/Signaturit/featured)\n\n*   [Legal Notice](https://www.signaturit.com/legal-notice/)\n*   [Cookie policy](https://www.signaturit.com/cookie-policy/)\n*   [Security policy](https://www.signaturit.com/security-policy/)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.signaturit.com/privacy-policy/)\n*   [Quality Policy](https://www.signaturit.com/quality-policy/)\n\n@Copyright Signaturit 2025\n\n \n\n![Image 98](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n![Image 100](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=20262775&tm=gtm002&Ver=2&mid=ba679fd7-d1b4-4c91-a1f0-dd2d12fa072f&bo=1&sid=b0839ac019f811f0be88f7cdcd546fb5&vid=b08dc8e019f811f0accca96e34cb659b&vids=1&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=800&sh=600&sc=24&tl=Pricing%20%7C%20Signaturit&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.signaturit.com%2Fpricing%2F&r=&lt=1801&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&cdb=AQIR&rn=288590)\n\n![Image 101: Cookiebot session tracker icon loaded](https://imgsct.cookiebot.com/1.gif?dgi=2ab275e9-1e4a-4473-958a-242d1f1243ee)",
