Pricing is per user in a workspace, with the choice of monthly or annual billing for each plan. We recommend exploring each plan\u2019s features to find the best fit, and you can start with a 14-day free trial to test the platform before deciding.\n\nAfter the 14-day free trial, you\u2019ll need to select a subscription plan to continue using NetHunt\u00a0CRM. Your data will remain secure, but your workspace will be locked until you choose a plan.\n\nDuring the trial period, you\u2019ll have access to all NetHunt\u00a0CRM features, with the exception of using custom SMTP for email campaigns.\n\nSure! The 14-day free trial period has no user limitations: you can invite as many colleagues to your workspace as you need.\n\nAnnual billing offers a 20% discount compared to monthly billing, helping you save on long-term costs.\n\nYou can subscribe to a plan using your credit or debit card.\n\nYou can easily change your plan at any time.
