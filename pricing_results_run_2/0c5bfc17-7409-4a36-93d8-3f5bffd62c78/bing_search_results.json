We\u2019re very responsive.\n\n[Visit our docs](https://www.convertcalculator.com/help/)\n\n### What skills do I need to get started?\n\n \n\nNone! We made a really powerful and simple to use editor to create your calculator. If you are trying to do complex calculations, experience with Excel could be useful. Otherwise our team is happy to help!\n\n### How long will it take me to get a calculator up and running?\n\n \n\nIt really depends on what kind of calculator you are building. Simple calculators can be up and running in 30 minutes. For more complex calculators it can take a couple of hours.\n\n### Do you have a free trial?\n\n \n\nYes! You can use ConvertCalculator without limits for the first month. After that, you can keep using it for free, but your calculators get disabled when you pass 100 monthly visits.\n\n### I'm on the Free plan, but my live calculators are disabled. Why?\n\n \n\nOur free plan is designed for companies with low website traffic. Users can stay on the free plan until they reach 100 visits per month. Once this limit is exceeded, your account will no longer be eligible for the free plan and your live calculators will be disabled. If you wish to reactivate your live calculators, you will need to subscribe to one of our paid plans.\n\n### How is usage calculated?\n\n \n\nWe calculate usage by looking at visits. Every time a calculator is loaded onto a page, we count it as a visit.\n\n### What happens when I'm over my limit?\n\n \n\nWe disable your calculators 2 days after you passed your monthly visit limit. Don't worry, we notify you when your usage is at 80% and 100%, so you have plenty of time to upgrade.\n\n### Am I tied to a contract?\n\n \n\nThere are absolutely no contracts with ConvertCalculator. You can cancel or pause you account at any time.\n\n### What's included in support?\n\n \n\nWe help you by answering all your questions and giving you instructions when you need them. We will especially help you with the setup of your equations and formulas; we know that this is the hardest part of the product!\n\n![Image
