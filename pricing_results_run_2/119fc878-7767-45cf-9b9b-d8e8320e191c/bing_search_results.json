That's our philosophy.\n--------------------------------------\n\n#### Standard\n\n###### For small businesses and solo practitioners\n\n$89\n---\n\n###### USD/Month\n\n[Get Started](https://app.precisefp.com/signup \"Start Your Free 14 Day Trial\")\n\n#### Enterprise\n\n###### For businesses with +10 employees\n\n#### For tailor made solutions and volume pricing, get in touch.\n\n[Contact Us](https://precisefp.com/contact-us \"Contact us for pricing\")\n\nPay as you grow\n---------------\n\nYour monthly price automatically updates when you add extra users, teams, or account profiles.\n\n#### Additional User\n\n###### Give account access to staff, colleagues, compliance officers, etc.\n\n###### +$49.00 USD/Month\n\n#### Additional Team\n\n###### Organize your account by department, office, location, etc.\n\n###### +$25.00 USD/Month\n\n#### 100 Account Profiles\n\n###### Client and prospect accounts are billed in packages of 100.\n\n###### +$15.00 USD/Month\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n##### How long is the trial?\n\nYour trial will last 14 days. After your trial ends, your account will activate automatically and your monthly subscription will begin. You can cancel your trial at any moment.\n\n##### Are there any limitations with the trial?\n\nThere are no limitations with the trial. Your account is a fully functioning account, complete with any integrations that you choose to activate.\n\n##### How do I reach support with questions?\n\nSupport help is available Mon \u2013 Fri, 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. EST. You can chat with us live from our website, or within PreciseFP itself. We strive to provide instant responses, but typically will respond in less than 5 minutes (if there happens to be a delay). We find chat to be extremely powerful and efficient as it allows us to share links and screen captures; something that is not possible over the phone.\n\n##### What is the difference between a user and a team?\n\nA user is someone that logs into the application. A user can be an advisor, assistant, paraplanner, compliance officer, office administrator, etc. There is no limit to the number of Users you can have on your monthly subscription, though beyond the first User these come at an additional cost.\n\nA team is where your clients and prospects will reside. Your account comes with one team but if you need to split your clients and prospects by department, location, office, etc, then you should create additional teams. Users assigned to a team are only able to access clients and prospects of that team.\n\n##### Can I add/remove users or teams whenever I want?\n\nYes. You are able to add and remove users, teams, clients, and prospects at any moment. Your monthly subscription price will automatically update whenever you add or remove a user, a team, a client or a prospect.\n\n##### Do you offer discounts?\n\nWe do not offer discounts at the moment. If you need more time to evaluate the application during your trial, feel free to reach out to us for an extension.\n\nCapture All Client Data with One Tool.
