Each step is 30s long **(+1min)**.  \n  \nYou then go on to receive 50 video or voice answers of 30s for each step of the videoask **(1min/respondent = +50min)**.  \n  \nYou'll also follow up with all those customers via video (using the reply feature) and receive replies from them too, processing around 2 min on avg per customer **(+100)**.  \n  \nYour total processing usage for the month will be: **151 minutes**.\n\n04\n\n### What happens if I go over my limit?\n\nIf you go over your limit, we will continue processing video/audio for you, however, you will be required to upgrade.\n\nYour processing counter will reset each month according to your sign up or subscription date (unused minutes don't carry over to the next month).\n\nfeatures\n\n[* Live calls](https://www.videoask.com/feature/live-call)[* Video funnels](https://www.videoask.com/feature/video-funnel)[* Video chatbots](https://www.videoask.com/feature/video-chatbot)[* Video Forms](https://www.videoask.com/feature/video-form)[* Asynchronous video interviews](https://www.videoask.com/feature/one-way-interview)[* Direct messaging](https://www.videoask.com/feature/direct-messaging)[* NPS](https://www.videoask.com/feature/NPS)[* Embed widget](https://www.videoask.com/feature/embed-widget)\n\nuse cases\n\n[* Candidate sourcing](https://www.videoask.com/recruitment/candidate-sourcing)[* Candidate screening](https://www.videoask.com/recruitment/candidate-screening)[* Candidate selecting](https://www.videoask.com/recruitment/candidate-selecting)[* Onboarding](https://www.videoask.com/recruitment/candidate-onboarding)[* Lead generation](https://www.videoask.com/sales-marketing/lead-generation)[* Lead conversion](https://www.videoask.com/sales-marketing/convert-leads)[* Lead nurture](https://www.videoask.com/sales-marketing/lead-nurture)[* Testimonial collection](https://www.videoask.com/sales-marketing/testimonials)[* Maintain customer loyalty](https://www.videoask.com/sales-marketing/maintain-customer-loyalty)[* Education](https://www.videoask.com/education)[* Research & Feedback](https://www.videoask.com/research-feedback)[* Support](https://www.videoask.com/support)\n\nsupport\n\n[* Help Center](https://www.videoask.com/help)[* What's New](https://www.videoask.com/whats-new)[* Contact Support \ud83d\udc4b](mailto:support@videoask.com)[* Developer APIs](https://developers.videoask.com/)[* System status](https://status.videoask.com/)*   Careers[* Terms & conditions](https://admin.typeform.com/to/eWpkapYC)[* Report abuse](https://successteam.typeform.com/to/fmBA7igL)\n\n[* All rights \u00a9 Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[* Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/videoaskapp/)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[* YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYDLcu2CD508t240mHz9XTg)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[* Community](https://community.typeform.com/?utm_source=videoask&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=typeform_community&utm_term=footer)\n\nSign up\n\n### \ud83c\udf6a Cookie consent\n\nWe use our own and third-party cookies to understand your browsing and navigation history and show you more relevant content based on it.
