number of MAUs that's included in your plan, you will be automatically upgraded with the additional bundles fitting to your level at a rate of **$50**/month per additional **5,000** MAUs. The owner of the account will receive an email notification when this happens.\n\nWhat is the difference between internal and external \"AND\" or \u201cOR\u201d conditions when creating filters?\n\nWhen building segments, both internal and external filters use the same \"AND\" or \u201cOR\u201d logic. But, they are presented differently in the interface. Here's a breakdown: **1\\. Internal Filters (Grouped):** When you click the \"+\" icon to add a filter, this action groups the filters internally. This means the filters are treated as a single logical block, where conditions within that group must all be met together. It\u2019s like grouping specific criteria that work hand-in-hand. For example, you can group filters based on post clicks and web visits, so those conditions will be checked as a combined requirement.\n\n![Image 13: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/670e0df33b1f49bcbff03e49_Screenshot-2024-10-08-at-5.40.55-PM-400x110.png)\n\n**Example:** Suppose you want to create a segment of users who have been active recently. You could group the following conditions:\n\n![Image 14: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/670e0df396bb9ad52496ee70_Screenshot-2024-10-09-at-4.01.50-PM.png)\n\nIn this case, both conditions must be met together. The system will only include users who meet **both** criteria as part of the segment, treating them as a single logical block. **2\\. External Filters** When you select \"Add Filter\", you are adding a new condition that is treated externally. This means the conditions are evaluated separately, and the \"AND\" or \u201cOR\u201d combines the results from these separate conditions. These filters don't interact as a block but instead apply independently, where all conditions must be true for the segment to work.\n\n![Image 15: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/670e0df361868ff9e8924d5a_Screenshot-2024-10-08-at-5.41.31-PM-400x103.png)\n\n**Example:** Let\u2019s say you want to create a segment that includes users with specific conditions. You could set the following criteria:\n\n![Image 16: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/img/image-placeholder.svg)\n\nIn this example, the first two conditions are grouped internally, meaning both must be true. Additionally, the external condition specifies that the **User ID** must be **1234**. All three conditions must be true for a user to be included in the segment. **In Summary:**\n\n*   **\"+\" (internal grouping):** Combines filters into a single block where all conditions must be met together.\n*   **(External):** Adds filters that are evaluated separately but must still all be true for the segment.\n\nThough the presentation of the filters varies, the \"AND\" or \u201cOR\u201d logic remains the same for both internal and external filters. To conclude, both the \"+\" and \"Add Filter\" options function the same way. The \"AND\" or \"OR\" logic works the same whether the filters are grouped internally or added externally. The only difference is how the filters are visually grouped in the interface, but the outcome will remain identical.\n\nHow to Customise the Position of the Widget Icon?\n\nYou can customise the position of your widget icon in two ways to enhance its placement within your application. Here are two primary methods to achieve this: **1\\. Using the Widget Settings Menu**\n\n*   Navigate to the [widget settings](https://app.getbeamer.com/settings#widget) in your Beamer dashboard.\n*   In the settings, find the option to select the widget\u2019s position.\n*   Click on the dropdown menu to view available position options such as **top**, **bottom**, **left**, and **right**.\n\n![Image 17: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/670e0eec73a2092a02cc3200_Screenshot-2024-10-08-at-5.29.12-PM-400x208.png)\n\n*   Choose your desired position, and the widget will automatically adjust to the selected placement.\n\n#### **2\\. Adjusting the Notification Bubble Offset**\n\n*   Customise the widget's position further through the notification bubble offset settings.\n*   Specify precise positioning by entering pixel (PX) values for the widget\u2019s placement.\n\n![Image 18: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/670e0eedac7fc697f965b374_Screenshot-2024-10-08-at-5.29.45-PM-400x74.png)\n\n*   Modify the **top**, **right**, **bottom**, and **left** values to position the widget exactly where you want it on the screen.\n*   This method allows for fine-tuning, ensuring the widget does not interfere with other elements of your application\u2019s UI.\n\n#### **3\\. Using Custom CSS**\n\n*   **Local CSS Customization**: You can also customize the widget\u2019s position using your local CSS styles.\n*   **Target Widget Elements**: Use CSS selectors to target the widget's elements and apply styles like position, top, left, right, and bottom to adjust its placement according to your design needs.\n\nWhy is my post not appearing on the standalone page?\n\nIf your post isn't appearing on the standalone page, follow these steps:\n\n1.Ensure you have selected \u201c**standalone\u201d** in the changelog options for your post.\n\n![Image 19: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/670e103f7839d67d69779b3d_Screenshot-2024-10-08-at-5.19.58-PM-400x186.png)\n\n2.Double-check that the category you've selected for your post is also included in the **standalone categories** list.\n\n![Image 20: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/670e103f6c7fe6dc13924cd0_Screenshot-2024-10-08-at-5.20.39-PM-400x155.png)\n\nSometimes, even if you've correctly categorised your post, it may not appear in the standalone page unless that specific category is enabled for standalone display. To verify this:\n\n*   Go to your [**settings**](https://app.getbeamer.com/settings#product) \\> [**standalone settings**.](https://app.getbeamer.com/settings#standalone)\n*   If the category of your post is not listed there, you'll need to manually add the category to ensure your post gets displayed.\n\n![Image 21: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/670e103fb8ced97b5cf0b721_Screenshot-2024-10-08-at-5.22.36-PM-400x168.png)\n\nIf your segmented post is not showing up on the standalone page, please refer to the document linked below: [Why is my segmentation post not appearing on the standalone page?](https://www.getbeamer.com/help/why-is-my-segmentation-post-not-appearing-on-the-standalone-page).\n\nWhere Beamer data is saved and what is the data?\n\nBy default, all Beamer data is stored in US-based servers and databases. However, Beamer offers the option to migrate end-user data to EU-located servers if that aligns better with your compliance or privacy needs. If you prefer to store data in the EU, simply reach out to Beamer support to make this request. Beamer collects various types of data based on your usage, which include:\n\n*   User interaction data\n*   NPS survey responses\n*   User segmentation information\n*   Any filters you set in the Beamer configuration script\n\nFor further details on the specific data collected and how it\u2019s used, you can refer to Beamer\u2019s [Privacy Policy](https://www.getbeamer.com/privacy-policy/#personal-information).\n\nWhat are the different scores compared to the NPS 10 scale?\n\nWhen comparing various scoring systems to the traditional NPS (Net Promoter Score) 10-point scale, the scores can be aligned as follows:\n\n### Comparison to NPS 10-Point Scale:\n\n*   **1 on a 1-5 scale** = **2 on a 0-10 scale**\n*   **2 on a 1-5 scale** = **4 on a 0-10 scale**\n*   **3 on a 1-5 scale** = **7 on a 0-10 scale**\n*   **4 on a 1-7 scale** = **9 on a 0-10 scale**\n*   **5 on a 1-5 scale** = **10 on a 0-10 scale**\n\n![Image 22: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/66f6771eeb0748edd741f8a7_Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-10.34.16%25E2%2580%25AFAM-400x175.png)\n\nSimilarly, when using alternatives like emojis or a 5-star system, the values get converted accordingly. For instance, if a user selects **3/5 emojis**, this might translate to around **7** on the 0-10 NPS scale.\n\n### 3 Scale Emoji Display Type:\n\n*   **Sad** \u2192 **1** (Detractor)\n*   **Neutral** \u2192 **7** (Neutral)\n*   **Happy** \u2192 **10** (Promoter)\n\n### NPS Calculation Formula:\n\n*   **Promoters:** Scores of 9-10\n*   **Passives/Neutrals:** Scores of 7-8\n*   **Detractors:** Scores of 1-6\n\n![Image 23: summary image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b70736e94ee47108b9f364/66f6771e9d8426afea476018_Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-10.35.36%25E2%2580%25AFAM-400x49.png)\n\n### Note on Accuracy:\n\nWhile converting scores from alternative scales to the NPS 10-point scale can be helpful, the granularity and interpretation may vary, so accuracy may decrease when switching systems.\n\nHow do the initial time and delay for NPS gets calculated?\n\nThe initial timing for displaying the **NPS** (Net Promoter Score) survey to users can be customized through various settings in your NPS dashboard. Here\u2019s how the timing is calculated and adjusted: **1\\. Initial Delay**: Setting: NPS Dashboard \\> NPS Settings \\> INITIAL DELAY **Description**: The \"Initial Delay\" setting determines how much time must pass after Beamer first detects a user before the NPS survey is shown to them.

Can I use AND and OR?\n\nIn Beamer, **segmentation** allows you to target specific users with posts, ensuring that the content is relevant to the audience you want to reach. As of now, Beamer supports two types of segmentation:\n\n*   Basic segmentation\n*   Advanced segmentation\n\n**Basic Segmentation (Default OR Condition):** Basic segmentation allows you to display specific Beamer posts to users by passing segment values in the filter parameter of your Beamer embed code. \u00a0It operates by default using the OR condition. This means: If you assign multiple segments to a post, the post will be displayed to users who match at least one of the segments. It enables broader targeting, as users only need to meet any one of the criteria. **Note:** Basic segmentation is available from the **PRO** subscription plan only. **How to Create a Basic Segment: 1. Pass segment values in the filter parameter.** In your Beamer embed code, you specify which segments (filters) the current user belongs to by passing them in the filter parameter. **Example Code:**\u200d\n\n```\n<script>\n    var beamer_config = {\n        product_id: \"YOUR_PRODUCT_ID\", // Replace with your Beamer product \n        IDfilter: \"admin;test\", // Replace with the user's segments\n    };\n</script>\n<script src=\"https://app.getbeamer.com/js/beamer-embed.js\" defer></script>\u200d\n```\n\nReplace **YOUR\\_PRODUCT\\_ID** with your actual product ID. Replace **\"admin;test\"** with the segments applicable to the current user, separated by semicolons **;** For detailed instructions, please refer to our guide: [How to Use Segmentation](https://www.getbeamer.com/help/how-to-use-segmentation)**Select Segments in Posts:** When creating or editing a post in the Beamer dashboard: 1.Go to the Post Editor: 2.Click on \"Create Post\" 3.Assign Segments to the Post: 4.In the \"Segment filters\" field, enter the segments you want to assign to the post. **Example:** Type **admin;test** to assign both segments to the post. **Note**: Use semicolons **;** to separate multiple segments. **Assigning segments in the post editor:** When creating or editing a post in your Beamer dashboard, you can assign one or more segments to it. **Example**: Assign the segments admin and test to a post. **Understanding the OR Condition:Multiple Segments:** If you assign multiple segments to a post (e.g., admin and test), users who match any of those segments will see the post. **Example:**\n\n*   A user with the admin segment will see the post.\n*   A user with the test segment will also see the post.\n*   A user with both admin and test segments will see the post.\n\nThis OR condition ensures that your content reaches a broader audience who meet at least one of the criteria. **Advanced Segmentation (AND & OR):** Advanced Segmentation allows you to create complex segments directly in Beamer using your user data. It supports both AND and OR conditions, enabling you to target users who meet specific combinations of criteria. **Features:**\n\n*   **Create Segments from User Attributes:** Use standard and custom user attributes to build segments.\n*   **Combine filters with AND/OR logic:** define precise targeting conditions.\n*   **Ideal for precise targeting:** Reach specific user groups based on detailed criteria.\n\n**Note**: Advanced Segmentation is available in the **Scale and Custom** subscription plans. Access the Users Tab. Click on Users create segmentation, and add filters or pass custom user attributes via script. For more details, please check out our comprehensive guide: Advanced Segmentation Guide \u2013 Custom User Attributes \u00bb\n\nHow do two boosted announcements work?\n\nIf you have two boosted announcements scheduled at the same time, only the most recent announcement will be displayed to your users. If you publish or update two boosted notifications or two updates together, the newer one will replace the older one. The older announcement will no longer appear, as Beamer prioritises displaying the latest content to ensure users see the most up-to-date information. This way, only the recent boosted announcement or update gets shown to users, preventing them from being overwhelmed by multiple announcements at once.\n\nWhat happens if I edit/republish a post?\n\nWhen you edit or update an already published post in Beamer, no new notifications\u2014such as email or push notifications\u2014will not be triggered again. These notifications are sent only once when the post is first published. However, the in-app notifications and boosted announcements (such as **Topbar**, **Popup**, **Snippet**, and **Tooltip**) will reflect the updated content in real time for users who have not yet seen the post. This will allow users to still see the latest version without being overwhelmed by multiple notifications for the same post\n\nWhat is the maximum size for uploading media files?\n\nBeamer limits media file uploads (including GIFs, images, and videos) to **10 MB** for optimal performance. If your file exceeds this size, you\u2019ll need to reduce the size before uploading. To ensure fast load times and a smooth experience for your users, we recommend using smaller file sizes or compressing large files. If your media still exceeds the limit, consider hosting it externally (e.g., YouTube for videos) and embedding the link in your post.\n\nHow much does User Onboarding cost?\n\nUser Onboarding is built and managed by our partner, [Userflow](https://userflow.com/?utm_source=getbeamer.com/pricing&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=faq-cost-homepage). For more information or to start a 14-day free trial, please visit their [pricing](https://userflow.com/pricing?utm_source=getbeamer.com/pricing&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=faq-cost-pricing) page.\n\nIs User Onboarding a Beamer product?\n\nUser Onboarding is built and managed by our partner, [Userflow](https://userflow.com/?utm_source=getbeamer.com/pricing&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=faq-product). [Beamer](https://www.getbeamer.com/) and Userflow merged to help SaaS teams unify their customer journeys with a complete toolkit that combines user communication and effective product guidance. Sharing User Onboarding is the first step in this exciting new chapter for Beamer and Userflow.\n\nIs Beamer really free?\n\n[Changelog](https://www.getbeamer.com/changelog), [Feedback](https://www.getbeamer.com/feedback), and [NPS](https://www.getbeamer.com/nps) all have a completely free plan option. You can also mix and match paid products and free products on your Beamer plan depending on your needs. User Onboarding by [Userflow](https://userflow.com/) has a free 14-day trial, no credit card necessary.\n\nWhat are push notifications?\n\nPush notifications allows you to sends notifications to users that are not currently on your website or app. Users will be shown a customizable opt in prompt and will be able to suscribe to your updates. You can enable push notifications on a post by post basis - ie. you can choose which posts to send push notifications for. These notifications work with Chrome (web and mobile), Firefox, Edge and Opera. Learn [how to get push notifications here](https://www.getbeamer.com/help/how-to-get-push-notifications), or [how to enable them here.](https://www.getbeamer.com/help/how-to-setup-and-use-push-notifications)\n\nCan I use a Beamer account on multiple websites?\n\nYes, you can embed the same changelog in multiple accounts or manage multiple changelogs with a single users. The latter option means that you have a single user (email and password) linked to multiple accounts. Each of them will be billed separately and you may have different plans for each one of them. To learn how to create multiple accounts [please read this quick tutorial.](https://www.getbeamer.com/help/how-to-manage-multiple-accounts)\n\nWhat are my payment options?\n\nFor [monthly plans](https://www.getbeamer.com/pricing) we accept any major credit card. For yearly plans, payment can be made via **credit card**, **PayPal**, **ACH**, or by **bank transfer** (USA and Europe only).\n\nWhat is user segmentation?\n\nUser segmentation can be used to send targeted messages to specific groups of users. For example, you can show different posts to paying users and non-paying or logged in users and logged out. You can also show different feeds to users based behaviour such as past purchases from your store or which specific page they are visiting on your domain. To activate user segmentation you simply need to tag your users and send these tags through your Beamer script. Learn more in this [guide](https://www.getbeamer.com/help/how-to-use-segmentation) or in our [Developer Docs](https://www.getbeamer.com/docs).\n\nHow are Monthly Active Users (MAU's) calculated?\n\n**Monthly active users** (MAUs) are calculated as the number of unique users who access any page where Beamer\u2019s script is embedded or on the standalone page in a given month. We don\u2019t charge for inactive users who might be in your database but don\u2019t sign in or visit your website during a given month.\n\n**How do you differentiate unique users?** With Beamer, you have the option to track and process user data using standard parameters like _`user_id`_. This is a unique identification value that will help to track a user even if the other data parameters are changed such as logging on from a different device and ensure that it only counts as a single user, not multiple. We use this _`user_id`_ to count your Monthly Active Users and it can help you understand what your users want and how they interact with your content (views, clicks, feedback, and more). If not, by default, Beamer will rely on a cookie stored in the browser to identify unique users. This approach is less reliable because:\n\n1.  Users can clear their browser\u2019s cookies.\n2.  The same user can connect from different browsers/devices and each new device or browser that they access Beamer on will count towards your Monthly Active User count.\n\nYou can add additional bundles of **5,000** MAUs at **$50**/month. [**For more information on sending user data to Beamer and how it can help you understand your users better, check out this article.**](https://www.getbeamer.com/help/how-to-send-user-data-to-the-beamer-script)\n\nIs there any limit for API requests?\n\nYes - there is a monthly limit of **2,000 API requests in Starter, 20,000 in Pro and 100,000 in Scale.** If this limit is exceeded additional API requests will be charged at $49 for the first extra block of 100K API requests and $19 / additional 100K blocks after that.\n\nWhat is Beamer\u2019s privacy policy?\n\nYour privacy is important to us.
