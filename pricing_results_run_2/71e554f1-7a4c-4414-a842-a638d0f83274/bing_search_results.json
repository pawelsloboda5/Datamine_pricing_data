Drip doesn\u2019t require your credit card info in order to start a trial. You won\u2019t be charged until you upgrade by providing your payment information.\n\n[Do you restrict features while on the free trial?](javascript:void(0))\n\nUnlimited emails are not available during your free trial. Other than that, you have free rein to use all of Drip\u2019s features. Here are a few we think you\u2019ll like:\n\n*   Automated workflows based on customer activity\n*   90+ integrations (including to Shopify, BigCommerce, and WooCommerce)\n*   Email templates and visual builder\n\n[What happens when my free trial expires?](javascript:void(0))\n\nAfter 14 days you will be prompted to upgrade to a paid plan and enter your credit card information.\n\n[Do I need to have an ecommerce store to use Drip?](javascript:void(0))\n\nNo. It\u2019s not a requirement to have an ecommerce store to use Drip, however, we are built specifically for ecommerce and you will get the most out of our platform and features if you\u2019re an online store.\n\n[How does pricing work?](javascript:void(0))\n\nYour cost is based on the number of active people in your account and the volume of emails you send during the month.\n\n[Can I cancel anytime?](javascript:void(0))\n\nYes. Cancel your subscription anytime in your Billing Settings.\n\n[Can I upgrade before my trial is over?](javascript:void(0))\n\nYou sure can! Upgrade at any time under **Settings \\> Billing**. After you enter your CC info you will have access to unlimited email sends.\n\n[What's the setup process like?](javascript:void(0))\n\nWe've made the setup as painless as possible. It's a simple three-step process; connect your ecommerce shop to Drip, import your list, and activate your campaign or workflow. Then it's off to the races.\n\n[Can I integrate with other apps during my free trial?](javascript:void(0))\n\nOf course \u2014 in fact, we encourage it! Connect your order management system / ecommerce store to Drip during your free trial period so you can take full advantage of our features: revenue dashboards, ecommerce automations, dynamic content blocks, and more.\n\n[When will I get charged for my trial?](javascript:void(0))\n\nBecause we don\u2019t ask for your credit card info in order to take a trial, your card won\u2019t get charged unless you choose to upgrade your account. However, if you don\u2019t upgrade your account and your trial expires, then your account will become inactive and any active forms and campaigns will be paused until you upgrade. You can upgrade by going into the \u201cBilling\u201d section under \u201cSettings\u201d at any time.\n\n[I just want to see how Drip works.](javascript:void(0))\n\nAbsolutely. Sign up for a [free trial](https://www.drip.com/signup) to see Drip in action.\n\n[What type of support is offered?](javascript:void(0))\n\nAll paying Drip customers have access to email support from 9 am to 5 pm CT, Monday through Friday. Drip customers on the $99/mo + plans have access to live chat support from 9 am to 5 pm CT, Monday through Friday.\n\nTake your marketing strategy to the next level.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nBook a free live demo of Drip today.\n\n[Demo Drip](https://www.drip.com/book-a-demo)\n\nOr [start free trial \u2192](https://www.drip.com/signup/)\n\nDrip\n\nDrip\n----\n\n[Integrations](https://www.drip.com/integrations) [Customers](https://www.drip.com/customers) [Book a Demo](https://www.drip.com/book-a-demo) [Start a Trial](https://www.drip.com/signup-v1) [Free Migration](https://www.drip.com/services/migration)\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlatforms\n---------\n\n[Shopify](https://www.drip.com/shopify) [WooCommerce](https://www.drip.com/woocommerce) [BigCommerce](https://www.drip.com/bigcommerce) [Custom Stores](https://www.drip.com/custom-stores) [TourAdvantage powered by Drip](https://www.drip.com/touradvantage)\n\nSupport\n\nSupport\n-------\n\n[Help Center](https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us) [Contact](https://www.drip.com/contact) [Privacy](https://www.drip.com/privacy) [Status](https://status.drip.com/)\n\nLearn\n\nLearn\n-----\n\n[Blog](https://www.drip.com/blog) [Podcast](https://www.drip.com/podcast) [Resources](https://www.drip.com/resources) [API Reference](https://developer.drip.com/) [Workflow Templates](https://www.drip.com/templates/workflows) [Release Notes](https://www.drip.com/release-notes)\n\nProduct\n\nProduct\n-------\n\n[Onsite](https://www.drip.com/product/onsite-marketing) [Email Marketing](https://www.drip.com/product/email-marketing) [Automation](https://www.drip.com/product/marketing-automation) [Segmentation Reports](https://www.drip.com/product/segmentation) [Insights & Guidance](https://www.drip.com/product/insights)\n\nComparisons\n\nComparisons\n-----------\n\n[Drip vs. ActiveCampaign](https://www.drip.com/comparisons/activecampaign) [Drip vs. Klaviyo](https://www.drip.com/comparisons/klaviyo) [Drip vs. MailChimp](https://www.drip.com/comparisons/mailchimp) [All Comparisons](https://www.drip.com/comparisons)\n\nCompany\n\nCompany\n-------\n\n[About](https://www.drip.com/about) [Careers](https://www.drip.com/careers) [Diversity, Equity & Inclusion](https://www.drip.com/diversity-equity-inclusion) [Partners](https://www.drip.com/partners)\n\nFollow us\n\nFollow us\n---------\n\n[](https://www.drip.com/go/community-slack \"Slack\")[](https://www.facebook.com/getdripapp \"Facebook\")[](https://twitter.com/getdrip \"Twitter\")[](https://www.instagram.com/getdripapp/ \"Instagram\")[](https://www.tiktok.com/@get_drip_app \"Tiktok\")[](https://open.spotify.com/user/312r5372lveav2by67ng35uyruwi?si=8d4b1fc3196a4009&nd=1 \"Spotify\")[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/getdrip \"Linkedin\")[](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCorLY3m-KyLXc8k78VhdvoA \"YouTube\")\n\n[![Image 28: Apple iOS 18.2: What It Means for Your 2025 Email Marketing Strategy And Beyond Cover Image](https://1445333.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/1445333/hubfs/ios_18-2_update-BLOG.jpg?width=480&name=ios_18-2_update-BLOG.jpg)](https://www.drip.com/blog/apple-ios-18-what-it-means-for-your-2025-email-marketing-strategy-and-beyond)\n\n[Email Marketing](https://www.drip.com/blog/tag/email-marketing)\n\n### [Apple iOS 18.2: What It Means for Your 2025 Email Marketing Strategy And Beyond](https://www.drip.com/blog/apple-ios-18-what-it-means-for-your-2025-email-marketing-strategy-and-beyond)\n\n![Image 29: Laura Gee Headshot](https://www.drip.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Drip%20Website/Blog%20Authors/Laura%20Gee.jpg?width=48&height=48&name=Laura%20Gee.jpg)\n\nBy [Laura Gee](https://www.drip.com/blog/author/laura-gee)\n\nDiscover how Apple's iOS 18.2 updates, including AI summaries and Branded Mail, will impact your email marketing strategy in 2025 and beyond.\n\n[Read this post](https://www.drip.com/blog/apple-ios-18-what-it-means-for-your-2025-email-marketing-strategy-and-beyond)\n\n4 min read\n\n[](https://www.drip.com/go/community-slack \"Slack\")[](https://www.facebook.com/getdripapp \"Facebook\")[](https://twitter.com/getdrip \"Twitter\")[](https://www.instagram.com/getdripapp/ \"Instagram\")[](https://www.tiktok.com/@get_drip_app \"Tiktok\")[](https://open.spotify.com/user/312r5372lveav2by67ng35uyruwi?si=8d4b1fc3196a4009&nd=1 \"Spotify\")[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/getdrip \"Linkedin\")[](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCorLY3m-KyLXc8k78VhdvoA \"YouTube\")\n\n\u00a9 Drip.
