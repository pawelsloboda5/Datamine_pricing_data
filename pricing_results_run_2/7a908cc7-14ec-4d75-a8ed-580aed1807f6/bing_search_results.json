With Freshsales, we brought it down to about 20%, and time is money.\n\nMike HopkinsSenior VP, Sales and Service, Blue Nile\n\n[Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ajpKwcCjv4)\n\n![Image 34](blob:http://localhost/1be6e0052947ac43b7c70b1567b28368)![Image 35](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nOver the last year, we\u2019ve acquired 10X more customers and are rapidly scaling. To our surprise and relief, through this busy phase, the time spent on administrative tasks by teams dropped by 20%.\n\nAlexandraCRM Operations Manager, Humn\n\n[Read Story](https://www.freshworks.com/crm/resources/case-study/humn/)\n\n![Image 36](blob:http://localhost/1be6e0052947ac43b7c70b1567b28368)![Image 37](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nWe were able to gather intent data from email engagement and profile our audience and market to niches better. In a nutshell, the CRM became integral to our organization, rather than a supporting force.\n\nArun RajamaniHead \u2013 Digital Sales, Sify\n\n[Read Story](https://www.freshworks.com/crm/resources/case-study/sify-technologies/)\n\n![Image 38](blob:http://localhost/1be6e0052947ac43b7c70b1567b28368)![Image 39](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### How does the 21-day trial work?\n\nWhen you sign up, you instantly get access to the fully-loaded CRM for 21 days. We will email you when your trial expires. You can then select a plan and pay by credit card to continue using the product. If you choose not to continue, your account will be suspended.\n\n### Is my data safe?\n\nAt Freshworks, we take data security seriously. Our servers are hosted in a world-class data center that is protected by 24-hour surveillance and we ensure that our application is always up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n\n### What types of payment do you accept?\n\n1\\. Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express credit cards are accepted across currencies (American Express and Discover cards are not accepted for INR currency).\n\n2\\. We accept check payments in USD currency and this applies only for US and Canada customers.\n\n### What is a bot session?\n\nA bot session is any unique interaction between an end-user and a bot. On chat, all end-users to bot interactions in a day are counted as 1 bot session and lasts for a maximum of 24 hours. Only customer-facing AI bot features consume bot sessions while agent-facing AI features and bots don\u2019t consume bot sessions.\n\n### Do I get free AI agent sessions?\n\nWe offer 500 sessions with all paid plans to try out chatbots. This is limited to once per account. Once exhausted, you can buy additional sessions based on your requirements.\n\n### How can I buy additional bot sessions? What\u2019s the validity of the sessions?\n\nYou can purchase an unlimited number of bot sessions using the AI agent add-on. The validity of bot sessions aligns with your payment cycle.
