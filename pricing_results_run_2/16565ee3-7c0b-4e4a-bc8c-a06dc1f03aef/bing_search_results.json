more](https://katanamrp.com/onboarding-overview/)\n\n### Frequently asked questions\n\n##### How do the sales order and GMV limit calculations work?\n\nEach plan (Starter, Standard, Professional, and Professional Plus) offers a different usage limit, which is measured by both:\n\n*   The number of Sales orders marked as\u00a0**Delivered**\n*   The gross merchandise value (GMV) of\u00a0**Delivered sales orders**\n\nPlan prices are stated in annual terms, but pricing limits are actually calculated based on monthly usage in equal bundles over the past three months. This means if your sales orders\u00a0_or_\u00a0GMV exceed the monthly limit for\u00a0**three consecutive months**, your account is automatically upgraded to a higher plan. Usage is calculated based on the past calendar month.\n\nSee\u00a0[this article](https://support.katanamrp.com/en/articles/8769527-understanding-the-core-limits-for-katana-plans)\u00a0for more information and example calculations.\n\n##### Can I cancel and change my subscription at any time?\n\nYes, you can upgrade or cancel your subscription at any time.\n\nDowngrading is possible when the sales order and GMV consumption are within the lower plan\u2019s limits during the past three consecutive months. Please get in touch with our customer support for more details about downgrading.\n\n##### I have short periods of high sales volumes \u2014 can I downgrade during the low-volume periods?\n\nWhile plan prices are stated in annual terms, pricing limits are actually calculated based on monthly consumption in equal bundles over the past three months. This means that if your sales orders\u00a0_or_\u00a0GMV exceed the monthly limit for\u00a0**three consecutive months**, your account is automatically upgraded to a higher plan. Limits are calculated based on the past calendar month to the beginning of the next month.\n\nIf you exceed sales order or GMV limits for two consecutive months but stay within the limits on the third month, your account will not be upgraded to a higher tier plan.\n\nSee\u00a0[this article](https://support.katanamrp.com/en/articles/8769527-understanding-the-core-limits-for-katana-plans)\u00a0for more information and example calculations.[](https://katanamrp.com/pricing/#)\n\n##### Why do I need an onboarding package when starting Standard and higher plans?\n\nKatana\u2019s Standard, Professional, and Professional Plus plans are designed for growing and large-scale businesses with complex inventory management requirements.\n\nBusinesses that use Katana\u2019s implementation are fully set up 2-3 times faster than those who set up on their own, and they are twice as likely to succeed in the long term. Our onboarding services come with a one-time fee and ensure that you get the most value from Katana \u2014 and get set up quickly and correctly.\n\n[Learn more about our onboarding services](https://katanamrp.com/onboarding-overview/).\n\n##### Why does the Advanced Manufacturing add-on get more expensive with higher-tier plans?\n\nThe Advanced Manufacturing add-on varies in price with our different plans because of the direct correlation between plan tier and expected usage. As you move to a higher-tier plan, it\u2019s designed to support larger operations, which typically involve higher volumes of manufacturing processes, more complex operations, and a greater demand for data processing resources.\n\nGet visibility over your sales and stock\n----------------------------------------\n\nWave goodbye to uncertainty with Katana Cloud Inventory\u00a0\u2014\u00a0AI-powered
