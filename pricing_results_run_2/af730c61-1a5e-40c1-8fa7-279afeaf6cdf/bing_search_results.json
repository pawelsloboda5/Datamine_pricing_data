Instead of business mail coming to your personal or workplace address, it gets delivered to your virtual mail provider. If you've chosen LegalZoom's virtual mail services, we\u2019ll receive your mail, sort everything, digitize it, and send it to your inbox.\n\nWhy should I use a virtual mail address for an LLC or other business entity?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to keep your actual business address private\u2014for example, if you run your business from your home\u2014a virtual mail address can help. Another reason you might want a virtual mail address is if you travel a lot. A virtual mailbox provider helps ensure you'll never miss anything important.\n\nIf you choose LegalZoom's virtual mail service, we can store or ship the mail you want, shred what you don\u2019t, and even filter out your junk mail. Additionally, you get to choose a high-profile address for your LLC, which can boost your company's credibility, impress customers, and help your business grow.\n\nAre virtual mailboxes safe?\n---------------------------\n\nYes.

And you can even enable multi-factor authentication to your account for an additional layer of protection.\n\n![Image 7: Man wearing a green shirt and denim apron standing in a warehouse holding packages and checking his LegalZoom virtual mail on his cell phone.](https://www.legalzoom.com/website-assets/images/business/business-operations/lz-virtual-mail-overview/img-375-virtual-mail-package.webp)\n\nCan I receive packages at a virtual mailbox?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nYes. LegalZoom's virtual mail service offers free package storage for up to 10 days. We also offer parcel and mail forwarding services.\n\nHow is virtual mail different from using a registered agent?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRegistered agents and virtual business address providers both receive mail on your behalf\u2014but there's an important difference. States require most business entities appoint a registered agent to receive physical legal notices and official mail from the state, as well as service of process. Virtual mailbox providers receive your regular business mail and packages.\n\nReady to get started with virtual mail?\n---------------------------------------\n\n[Select my plan](https://www.legalzoom.com/business/business-operations/lz-virtual-mail-overview.html#pricing)\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\nReady to get started with virtual mail?\n---------------------------------------\n\n[Select my plan](https://www.legalzoom.com/business/business-operations/lz-virtual-mail-overview.html#pricing)\n\nWhat our customers are saying\n-----------------------------\n\nI've never opened an envelope ...
