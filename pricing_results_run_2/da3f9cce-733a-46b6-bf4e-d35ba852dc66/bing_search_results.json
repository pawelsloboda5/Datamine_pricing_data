Please note that you also are responsible for the cost of your postage and insurance. For prepaid postage (from USPS), you can set up certain auto-refill amounts. For all the post-billed postage (from FedEx, UPS, etc.), you\u2019ll be billed just like you always have been.\n\n##### Can I change my plan?\n\n![Image 64: Accordion Toggle](https://www.shipstation.com/wp-content/themes/shipstation-blocks/src/img/icons/chevron-down.svg)\n\nSure thing! It\u2019s easy to change your account\u2019s plan to a different one. We\u2019ll be there if you have a sudden influx of orders and need to ship more than what your previous plan allowed. (In case you have a downturn, that\u2019s no problem, either; we\u2019ll be there.)\n\n##### Can I cancel my account at any time?\n\n![Image 65: Accordion Toggle](https://www.shipstation.com/wp-content/themes/shipstation-blocks/src/img/icons/chevron-down.svg)\n\nAbsolutely! Once you sign into the app, you can cancel your account by going into the settings and going to your subscription plan, or reach out to sales@shipstation.com. We\u2019ll be sad to see you go!\n\n##### When will I be charged?\n\n![Image 66: Accordion Toggle](https://www.shipstation.com/wp-content/themes/shipstation-blocks/src/img/icons/chevron-down.svg)\n\nIf you sign up for a free trial, we will not charge you a dime unless you upgrade your subscription to a paid plan level. If you need to purchase insurance or postage, we\u2019ll collect billing information to pay for services provided by those partners. If you want to upgrade to a ShipStation subscription, we\u2019ll bill you at the end of your 30-day free trial for the plan that you choose. Plans are charged for the following month of service.\n\n##### What marketplaces and shopping carts do you support?\n\n![Image 67: Accordion Toggle](https://www.shipstation.com/wp-content/themes/shipstation-blocks/src/img/icons/chevron-down.svg)\n\nWe strive to be there for wherever you sell and however you ship, so we\u2019re always working towards having every selling channel solution ever. [For the full list of our partners, check out this page](https://www.shipstation.com/partners/?country=all&category=all).\n\n##### Is there a fee to connect additional channels?\n\n![Image 68: Accordion Toggle](https://www.shipstation.com/wp-content/themes/shipstation-blocks/src/img/icons/chevron-down.svg)\n\nNothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Our mission is to make you efficient at fulfilling your orders \u2013 wherever you sell. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to charge you more if you want to use multiple selling channels to grow your sales. The only time you would see an additional fee is if the selling channel you want to connect is a Premium Integration.\n\n##### Is there a fee to connect my own carrier accounts through ShipStation?\n\n![Image 69: Accordion Toggle](https://www.shipstation.com/wp-content/themes/shipstation-blocks/src/img/icons/chevron-down.svg)\n\n\\*\\*ShipStation offers competitive shipping rates through direct agreements with carriers like USPS, UPS, DHL, and GlobalPost. However, accessing your own negotiated carrier rates through your own pre-existing carrier account connected to ShipStation will incur **[additional fees](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/22354433862555-Shipment-Fees-by-Plan#UUID-528f5f0c-414a-f421-6a4c-038de445de60)** that vary by plan level.\n\n$5 per month, Starter Plan  \n$20 per month, Growth-Bronze Plan  \n$30 per month, Growth-Silver Plan  \n$40 per month, Scale-Gold Plan  \n$60 per month, Scale-Platinum Plan  \n$95 per month, Scale-Enterprise Plan  \nPer shipment fee, High-Volume Plan\n\nThese fees are charged if a merchant (i) has its own independently negotiated carrier agreement, such as a negotiated service agreement with USPS, and (ii) decides to use the rates available under its own direct negotiated carrier agreement, instead of ShipStation\u2019s pre-negotiated shipping rates.\n\n[![Image
