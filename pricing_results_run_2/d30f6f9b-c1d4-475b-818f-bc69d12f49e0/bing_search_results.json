When a meeting is captured by someone in your organization, it will count toward your lifetime storage limit. If you need additional storage, you can upgrade to a Pro, Business, or Enterprise plan.\n\n**What happens if I ever go over my storage limits?**\n\nWhen you\u2019re at risk of going over your storage limits, Supernormal will send you an email notification with options for how to proceed.\n\n\u200d\n\nFor users on a Starter, Pro, or Business plan, if you go over your lifetime storage limit, your meetings will still be captured but you will not be able to review the notes until you upgrade your plan to include additional storage.\n\n**How do I upgrade my account?**\n\nTo upgrade your account, simply click on the \u201cUpgrade\u201d button near the notification bell on the Supernormal page, or click on your avatar and select \u201cUpgrade Plan\u201d.\n\nHow do I update my payment method?\n\nTo change or add a payment method:\n\n1.  Navigate to your avatar in the upper right corner of the Supernormal page\n2.  Select \"Manage Billing\" from the dropdown bar\n3.  Select Update under \"Payment Method\" and enter your new or updated card information\n\nYou are unable to remove your card details from our system while your account remains active. If you cancel your Supernormal subscription and delete your account, your card details will be deleted then.\n\nIf you are part of an organization and would like to change the admin on your account and update your account with their payment information, please reach out to us at help@supernormal.com.\n\nExplore our pricing options to access a world of possibilities with Supernormal.
