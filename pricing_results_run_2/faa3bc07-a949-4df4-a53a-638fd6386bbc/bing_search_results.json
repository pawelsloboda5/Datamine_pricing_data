need within one account\n\nMore attendees, presenters, and parallel events with add-ons\n\nMarketing automation to support your work\n\nGenerate leads with no limits\n\n### FAQ\n\nCan I try ClickMeeting before paying for a package?\n\nYes, of course! You can create a ClickMeeting free trial account to test our webinar service for 30 days. No payment details are required to open your free trial account. For the 30-day free trial, click [here](https://clickmeeting.com/free-signup).\n\nPlease note that if you opt for a subscription package, you will automatically skip the free trial period and will be asked to provide your payment details. The charges are made up front each month (30 days) or year (365 days) until you decide to fully cancel your account.\n\nHow can I understand the difference between the host and the presenter?\n\nThe ClickMeeting platform allows you to host your events by yourself or invite other users as presenters to help you run your virtual meetings or conferences. Please remember, however, that there are differences between the role of the host and the presenter.\n\nA host is also called the account owner who has access to the account panel and its billing details and can manage the account settings as well as the add-ons. The billing details or the add-ons can only be viewed and purchased by the host. As the host, you can schedule the events and provide any changes convenient to them.\n\nIn the event room, there is always one seat available for the host who can decide who is going to receive the presenter\u2019s rights, for instance, via sending an email invitation, link, or assigning the presenter\u2019s role to a chosen person in the event room. You can always take away the presenter\u2019s rights from the presenters and make them attendees. It is not obligatory for the host to join every event; the presenters can start the event on their own.\n\nA presenter is a person who is invited to an event by a host (the account owner) via individual email invitation or a link. The rights and the access to options available in the event room are the same for the presenter as for the host. Webinars and meetings can be started and finished also by the presenter \u2013 the host does not have to be present in the event room to do this.\n\nThe number of seats available for the presenters is dependent on the plan the account owner (host) decides to purchase. It can only be increased by the host who can purchase the Presenters\u2019 seats add-on. Additional seats for the presenters are available only in webinars, and they do not increase the default number of cameras and audio streams. In webinars, you can have a maximum of 8 cameras and microphones enabled at the same time.\n\nThe presenter has no access to the account panel, but only to the event room to which he received the email invitation. After the event is over, the presenter will receive a Thank-you email where he can find basic statistics from the conference. It is not advised to share the presenter\u2019s link with any other person due to losing the possibility to join the event room.\n\nIs there any add-on I can purchase to host two or more events at the same time?\n\nThe ClickMeeting platform allows you to purchase the Parallel events add-on to be able to host two or more events at the same time within one account, depending on your needs. You can purchase the add-on in the Account add-ons section available in the drop-down menu in your account.\n\nThe add-on can only be purchased by the account owner, meaning that no multiusers, subaccounts, or presenters have access to this section within one account. Please note that purchasing the add-on does not multiply the number of attendees who can join the event room. The number of people who can join each event room is designated according to the subscription plan you have decided to go with. If you notice that the number of seats available in the event room is not enough, you can upgrade your account to a higher subscription package only.\n\nOne Parallel events add-on allows you to host one additional event besides the event that you can host by default. It means that one purchased add-on allows you to host two events at the same time. If you decide to purchase two add-ons, it means you can host three events at the same time and so on.\n\nPlease note that the add-on is available within your account till the moment you decide to cancel it. You can cancel the add-on in the Billing details section in your account. If you do not need the Parallel event add-on in the next billing cycle, you should cancel it before the new billing cycle starts to avoid being charged for it.\n\nHow can I convert my account from the free trial to a paid package?\n\nAfter logging in to your account, the **Choose your plan** button will be displayed at the top of the screen. Click it, choose the service package (monthly or annual; Live or Automated) and provide all the necessary billing details, such as address, city or credit card number. Then, click the **Buy Now** button on the right side of the screen.\n\nAll details regarding payments update automatically when choosing between different plans.\n\nHow much does a ClickMeeting account cost and what are my payment options?\n\nAt the moment, we offer monthly and annual plans. The price is based on the subscription plan you choose.\n\nWe accept all major credit cards including VISA, Master Card, Discover and American Express. In countries where access to a credit card is limited, we accept payments via PayPal.\n\nThe annual plan includes up to 20% discount. We also offer discounts for nonprofit organizations. To learn more about this offer, please contact our Billing Department.\n\nI need an account to be used by several people in my organization. What can I do?\n\nIf you want several people to use the same account, you can either create a Multiuser account or Subaccount for them.\n\nChoose a **Multiuser** account if you want your co-workers, employees or contractors to use the same account but have their own login details. They will be able to log in to the main account and create and host their own events on your account. Please note, however, that this type of account allows only one person to host one event at a time. To be able to organize two or more events at the same time, you would want to purchase the **Parallel Event add-on**. To purchase a Multiuser account (you can have up to 3 Multiuser accounts), please upgrade your plan to the Live or Automated package.\n\nChoose a **Subaccount** if you would like to keep your co-workers\u2019, employees\u2019 or contractors\u2019 data private. Each person will get their own storage space as well as recording time allowances. To purchase a Subaccount, log in to the account, hover the pointer over your name in the right upper corner, go to the Account Add-Ons section and choose Subaccounts.\n\nPlease note that your Subaccount and Multiuser account users cannot purchase the add-ons or make any other payments within their accounts. The payments can only be made from and for the main account.\n\nHow do I upgrade or downgrade my ClickMeeting plan?\n\nTo upgrade your plan, log in to the account, hover the pointer over your name in the upper-right corner of the screen and go to the Billing details section. Next to the Plan size section, choose the Upgrade button.\n\nTo downgrade your plan, please contact our [Customer Success Team](https://clickmeeting.com/contact?clang=en). You can downgrade the plan to any paid plan currently available, beginning with the next subscription period. We highly encourage you to contact our specialists a few working days before the start of the new billing cycle. It will allow for efficient execution of changes and procedures.\n\nYou can downgrade the plan to any paid plan currently available, beginning with the next subscription period.\n\nPlease note that it is not possible to downgrade the paid plan back to a free trial account.\n\nPlease also note that downgrading your plan will result in the voidance of all the promo-codes.\n\nAre there any hidden costs for using ClickMeeting?\n\nThere are no hidden costs for using the standard ClickMeeting features.\n\nClickMeeting does offer additional features that are available at an extra cost, such as add-ons and toll-free phone numbers. The account owner can purchase these features from the main account.\n\nWhen adding a new credit card to a ClickMeeting account, you will be charged $1 for its authorization.
