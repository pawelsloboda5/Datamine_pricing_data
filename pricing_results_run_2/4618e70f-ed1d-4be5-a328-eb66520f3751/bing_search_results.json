When you choose a plan that works for you depending on your yearly transaction volume, no additional fees will be charged.\n\nWill I have any other expenses?\n\nOn top of your monthly payment for Sellfy, you will need to cover payment processing fees of PayPal or Stripe (typically 2.9% + 30\u00a2) depending on which payment gateway you choose.\n\nWhat happens if I go over yearly sales cap?\n\nIf you do exceed the limit for your current subscription plan, you will be expected to upgrade to the next subscription plan. We've specifically designed the tools and features for each plan to best assist you and your customers and we\u2019ll make sure to notify you if you have reached the amount of maximum revenue set for your plan. But, if the account has not upgraded, we may start to charge a 2% overage fee for the amount of revenue that has gone over the subscription plan limits.\n\n**What are email credits?**  \n\nEmail credits are the number of emails that can be sent using our built-in email marketing feature. You will get a set number of credits to use each month with either the Business or Premium plan. \u00a0If you exceed this limit, you can purchase more credits from merchant dashboard.  \n\n**Do I need to have a website to use Sellfy?**  \n\nNo, you can build a store on Sellfy and start selling instantly on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or any other social network. If you have a website, you can embed the \"buy now\" buttons, product widgets or the full Sellfy store anywhere on your site.\n\n**Can I sell without a PayPal account?**\n\nYes. If you don\u2019t have a PayPal account, you can still receive payments with Stripe. If both PayPal and Stripe do not allow receiving payments in your country - you can only use Sellfy to offer free products.\n\n**How do I get paid?**\n\nYou will receive money instantly after a purchase is made. Payments will be sent directly to your PayPal or Stripe account depending on which gateway you choose for payment processing.\n\n**What are the limits for digital products?**\n\nTotal number of digital products is unlimited. One digital product can contain up to 50 files, with an overall maximum size of 10 GB each.\n\n**What does migration mean?**\n\nThere are three types of migration, two of which are only available on select plans and each is intended to be a one-time service.  \n  \nEmail migration is available with all plans and with this, we'll import your email contacts to the built-in Marketing feature. (completed in 1-2 business days)  \n  \nProduct migration is available with the Business and Premium subscriptions. We'll assist in uploading your product files and/or product descriptions for you. (completed in 5-20 business days)  \n  \nStore design migration is available with an annual Business or Premium subscription. This means that our team can help you design your storefront by taking your current website design elements and incorporating them into your new Sellfy store. (completed in 5-20 business days)\n\n**Can I use Sellfy in my country?**\n\nOur platform is available worldwide. But, we do recommend you check that the payment methods that we support are available for your country. We currently offer Stripe and PayPal for payment collections. You can visit their sites to learn more.\n\nStill have questions?\n\nDon't hesitate to ask us anything that would help you decide which plan is the best for you.\n\n[Contact us](mailto:contact@sellfy.com?subject=Sellfy%20pricing%20question)\n\n![Image 8](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/602629d6026724b9e0a021c8/6294dc05f265fc514964b8a6_cta-bg.svg)![Image 9](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/602629d6026724b9e0a021c8/6294dc05f265fc514964b8a6_cta-bg.svg)![Image 10](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/602629d6026724b9e0a021c8/6294dc05f265fc514964b8a6_cta-bg.svg)\n\nOpen your online store today!\n-----------------------------\n\n[Start 14-day free trial](https://sellfy.com/auth/signup/)Create, market and sell your products \u2014 all from one place.\n\n##### Product\n\n[Home](https://sellfy.com/)[Features](https://sellfy.com/features/)[Pricing](https://sellfy.com/pricing/)\n\n##### Use Cases\n\n[Sell digital products](https://sellfy.com/sell/digital-products/)[Sell print-on-demand](https://sellfy.com/print-on-demand/)[Sell subscriptions](https://sellfy.com/sell/subscriptions/)\n\n##### Company\n\n[About](https://sellfy.com/about/)[Affiliates](https://sellfy.com/affiliates/)[Sitemap](https://sellfy.com/sitemap/)\n\n##### Useful resources\n\n[Blog](https://sellfy.com/blog/)[Getting started](https://sellfy.com/blog/getting-started-guide/)[YouTube calculator](https://sellfy.com/youtube-money-calculator/)[POD catalog](https://sellfy.com/pod-product-catalog/)[Sellfy alternatives](https://sellfy.com/alternatives/)\n\n##### Contact\n\n[Contact support](https://docs.sellfy.com/#contact)[Help docs](https://docs.sellfy.com/)\n\n##### Product\n\n[Terms](https://sellfy.com/terms/)[Privacy policy](https://sellfy.com/privacy/)\n\n[![Image 11](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f96916c846a8769a380ae65/5f969565846a87daea80b4a1_logotype.svg)](https://sellfy.com/pricing/#)\n\n[![Image 12](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/602629d6026724b9e0a021c8/647873a633593e56fc655055_instagram.svg)](https://www.instagram.com/sellfyhq/)[![Image 13](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/602629d6026724b9e0a021c8/65e88c2f10b671bebaf5a1a3_twitter-x.svg)](https://twitter.com/Sellfy)[![Image 14](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/602629d6026724b9e0a021c8/65e88c6332893e5bd35abb61_facebook.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/SellfyHQ)[![Image 15](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/602629d6026724b9e0a021c8/647873a633593e56fc655052_youtube.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/@SellfyHQ)\n\n     [![Image 16](https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/webflow-badge-icon-d2.89e12c322e.svg)![Image 17: Made in Webflow](https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/webflow-badge-text-d2.c82cec3b78.svg)](https://webflow.com/?utm_campaign=brandjs)\n\n![Image 18: Cookiebot session tracker icon loaded](https://imgsct.cookiebot.com/1.gif?dgi=fcf2c72f-043a-4f88-8d40-476fe276d0aa)\n\nOpen your store today for as low as $19/mo.
