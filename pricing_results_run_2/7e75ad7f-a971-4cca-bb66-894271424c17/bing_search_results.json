Our **Active User Warning System** helps you keep costs down by providing you an accurate count of the active user count over your last billing period. This allows you to lower the number of seats purchased and in turn your next months' bill. Check [Billing FAQ](https://freedcamp.com/Freedcamp_LxR/Freedcamp_Devel_yOf/wiki/wiki_public/view/uGeab) to learn more.\n\nWe have Read-Only and Guest roles - 'collaborators', which are perfect for clients and those people in your organization who only need to observe work and/or occasionally comment. Users invited as collaborators are not counted as active users and are free on our premium plans making Freedcamp even more affordable and easy to adopt. These permissions are perfect for involving contractors, clients, and teammates from other departments absolutely for free.\n\nFreedcamp for the People\n------------------------\n\nWe are on a mission to help those who may not be able to afford expensive collaboration tools, but still want to stay productive. Freedcamp supports thousands of good cause organizations, teachers, and students across 85 countries.\n\nAre you a student, teacher, or part of a non profit and want to use Freedcamp to collaborate on projects? Eligibility requirements are explained in more detail in the Freedcamp [for Nonprofits FAQ](https://freedcamp.com/Freedcamp_LxR/Freedcamp_Devel_yOf/wiki/wiki_public/view/yDbab) and the Freedcamp [for Education FAQ](https://freedcamp.com/Freedcamp_LxR/Freedcamp_Devel_yOf/wiki/wiki_public/view/xDbab).\n\nTo be considered for the special pricing options based on your team and company qualifications, please fill out the Freedcamp [for Nonprofits application](https://freedcamp.com/sp_application/npo) or the Freedcamp [for Education application](https://freedcamp.com/sp_application/education).\n\n![Image 2](https://cdn.freedcamp.com/frontpage/v5/img/for-people@2x.jpg)\n\nWorld Class Support = Happy Customers!\n--------------------------------------\n\nKarlo K.
