The only limitations on the Free plan are that you can send up to 500 emails/month to up to 250 contacts, and publish 50 Shopify reviews.\n\n### I can\u2019t decide: should I choose the Pro plan or Standard?\n\nTop reasons why customers choose the Pro plan over Standard include unlimited emails, bonus SMS credits equal to your monthly bill, priority support from a dedicated customer success manager, advanced reporting capabilities, and publishing unlimited Shopify product reviews. Still have questions or not sure which plan is best for you? Request a 15 minute meeting with our team here \u2192 [omnisend.com/demo](https://omnisend.com/demo).\n\n### How can I pay?\n\nWe accept VISA (credit, debit, prepaid), MasterCard (credit, debit, prepaid), and American Express (credit, prepaid) card payments. Discover, Diners Club, JCB, UnionPay cards are not supported.\n\n### This will be my first time setting up an automation workflow. Can I expect any help?\n\nAbsolutely. Our award-winning 24/7 support team is always available to assist you and answer any questions.\n\n### What if I need to send more emails than my monthly limit?\n\nIf you exceed your email sending limit on the Free or Standard plan, we\u2019ll give you the option to upgrade your plan (and we\u2019ll send you a friendly email too). You\u2019ll always be asked to confirm an account upgrade before it happens. Users on the Pro plan can send unlimited emails per month, however, our fair use policy applies in order to comply with our anti-spam policy.\n\n### I want to try SMS. How does SMS pricing work?\n\nSMS pricing is based on an SMS credits system. If you\u2019re choosing our Free or Standard plan, after you use up your bonus SMS, then you'll need to get an SMS credits subscription (starts at $20/month) in your account. If you\u2019re on our Pro you'll get bonus SMS credits equal to the price of your plan added to your account monthly e.g. if you pay $99/month for the Pro plan, you\u2019ll get $99/month in SMS credits.\n\n### Can I send MMS?\n\nYes, MMS is available so you can insert images or gifs into your text messages. MMS is available for US & Canada recipients only, while SMS (text-only messages) is available globally.\n\n### Do you offer migration support?\n\nYes, our 24/7 support team is always available if you need help with migrating.\n\n### I\u2019d like to get dedicated support to set everything up. Can I get a Customer Success Manager?\n\nAll Standard and Pro plan users with \\>$400/month spend get a dedicated Customer Success Manager who provides migration support, helps set your first automations & campaigns, and provides ongoing personalized support to make sure you\u2019re making the most of Omnisend.\n\n### I have more questions. How can I reach you?\n\nSimply send us an email at support@omnisend.com.
