[Contact us now](https://support.textmagic.com/contact-us/)\n\nThe best plan depends on your messaging volume and specific needs. All Textmagic plans are prepaid and include a set number of credits that can be used for texting and other services. Below are the key advantages and differences of each plan.\n\n*   **Essential** This **pay-as-you-go plan** is ideal for occasional texting with no commitments. It includes the prepaid credit that can be used for any Textmagic service at a standard rate. To start texting, you'll need to purchase a virtual number for an additional monthly fee, compared to the Professional plan. Your unused credit will never expire.\n*   **Professional** This **monthly plan** is perfect for predictable monthly messaging costs with volume discounts in your registration country. By subscribing to this plan, you will benefit from discounted message prices, one free virtual number, and free inbound texts. Any unused credits will roll over and remain active for up to 2 months from the date of purchase.\n*   **Connect** This **monthly plan** is suitable for customers who have a CPaaS account (Twilio, Vonage, Sinch, or Bandwidth) and want to integrate it with the Textmagic platform. With no code 2-minute quick setup, you can immediately start using all Textmagic web app features and its user-friendly interface while enjoying the lower messaging costs of your existing CPaaS provider. Any unused credits will roll over and remain active for up to 2 months from the date of purchase.\n\nYes, you can switch between plans whenever you wish simply by visiting the [Plans](https://app.textmagic.com/accounts/monthly-plans) page and selecting the desired messaging volume and plan.\u00a0 You can **Downgrade to the pay-as-you-go** (Essential plan), **Cancel** your current Professional or Connect plan, or select a new monthly plan that better suits your messaging volume.\n\n**BYOC** (Bring Your Own CPaaS) is a native no-code integration by Textmagic that lets businesses connect their CPaaS provider and link existing virtual numbers with the Textmagic platform. **CPaaS** (Communications Platform as a Service) is a cloud-based communication provider for texting and calling. Textmagic BYOC supports Twilio, Vonage, Sinch, and Bandwidth. **The Connect plan** is suitable only for those who prefer to connect their existing CPaaS provider instead of using the Textmagic default SMS gateway to dispatch text messages.\n\nTextmagic does not store PayPal, credit, or debit card details on this website. All payment data is securely stored and processed by a third-party PCI-compliant payment gateway - **Stripe**.\n\nYes, you can remove your payment methods from the [billing overview](https://app.textmagic.com/accounts/billing-overview) page at any time.\u00a0 **Essential plan:** If you remove the payment method, auto-recharge will be disabled, and you will need to top up manually. **Professional and Connect plans:**\u00a0 If you remove the payment method, your monthly plan will remain active until the next renewal. After that, you will be downgraded automatically to the Essential plan with a disabled auto-recharge.\n\n**UK customers** All customers from the UK will be charged VAT 20%. **EU customers** To avoid paying VAT, you need to enter your organization's registered VAT number into the Stripe portal while making the payment. Once you do this, you will no longer be charged VAT. **US customers** Textmagic applies sales tax to purchases in accordance with state nexus thresholds. The applicable tax rate varies based on your geographical region and is added to the purchase price. If you are eligible for a tax exemption, please **send your exemption certificate** to [support@textmagic.com](mailto:support@textmagic.com) **before making the payment.**\n\n**Essential plan:** With this pay-as-you-go plan, unused credit never expires and remains active forever.\u00a0 **Professional** and **Connect** plans: With these monthly plans, unused credit rolls over for up to 2 months. **Example**: The unused credit bought on January 15th will expire on March 1st (after 1.5 months), and the unused credit bought on March 1st will expire on May 1st (after 2 months).\n\n**Essential plan:** If auto-recharge is enabled, your account will automatically be topped up when the balance falls too low, according to the selected [auto-recharge settings](https://app.textmagic.com/accounts/billing-overview). Otherwise, you will need to manually buy credit each time to ensure uninterrupted service. **Profession** and **Connect** plans: The monthly plan will be renewed automatically if your balance falls critically low (depending on the selected plan) to ensure uninterrupted service.\u00a0 The [billing overview](https://app.textmagic.com/accounts/billing-overview) page allows you to manage your plans, billing details, auto-recharge settings, and review your costs summary.\n\nTo receive a refund for the unused SMS credit, please [contact us](https://support.textmagic.com/contact-us/). Please include your name, company name, email address, and the reason why you are requesting a refund.\n\nYes, you can [disable auto-recharge](https://app.textmagic.com/accounts/billing-overview) on the Essential plan anytime you wish. We highly recommend you use auto-recharge if:\n\n*   You have a [dedicated virtual number](https://app.textmagic.com/services/sender-settings/numbers) subscription, [Sender ID](https://app.textmagic.com/services/sender-settings/sender-ids), or an active [10DLC campaign](https://app.textmagic.com/services/sender-settings/10dlc).\u00a0\n*   You use a call forwarding service.\n*   Your service operations are very dependent on the SMS service.\n\nTo stop the Professional/Connect plan renewal, Go to the [Plans](https://app.textmagic.com/accounts/monthly-plans) page and Click \u201cDowngrade to pay-as-you-go\u201d or \u201cCancel plan.\u201d\n\nYes, discounts are available with the Professional monthly plans, which offer savings of up to 49%, and the Connect monthly plans, which offer savings of 80% compared to the Essential pay-as-you-go plan. You can switch between plans or upgrade whenever you want simply by visiting the [Plans](https://app.textmagic.com/accounts/monthly-plans) page.\n\nAffordable pay-as-you-go and subscription plans for business communication.
