Get in touch or visit our [Help Center](https://help.simpletexting.com/en/).\n\n### What are carrier fees?\n\nSome wireless carriers, such as Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and others, charge additional costs to send and receive messages. On average, these carrier fees amount to approximately $0.0025 per message in the United States and $0.0068 in Canada. We never mark these up. View the [full fee schedule](https://help.simpletexting.com/en/articles/4714940-carrier-fees-for-toll-free-numbers).\n\n### Do you offer a discount for nonprofits?\n\nNonprofits, churches, and other tax-exempt organizations receive 15% off any of our monthly plans.\n\n### Do I get charged if people text my number?\n\nAll incoming SMS messages are free! Incoming messages with photos or other media attached (MMS) cost 1 credit each.\n\n### What is the character limit for texts?\n\nSMS is limited to 160 characters and costs 1 credit each. With our extended messaging feature, you can send messages up to 306 characters. Each extended message costs 2 credits. MMS allows up to 1,600 characters, costs 3 credits each.\n\n### How do rollover credits work?\n\nOn monthly plans, remaining plan credits roll over until the end of the following month. Before dipping into your rollover credits, we\u2019ll pull from the credits on your plan first. If you downgrade your plan, your rollover credits will be lost. Read more about [rollover credits](https://help.simpletexting.com/en/articles/1944286-do-message-credits-roll-over).\n\nBig decision, we know.  \nWhy not try it first?\n----------------------------------------------\n\nSend yourself a text to see how things work before you decide to use SimpleTexting for your business.
