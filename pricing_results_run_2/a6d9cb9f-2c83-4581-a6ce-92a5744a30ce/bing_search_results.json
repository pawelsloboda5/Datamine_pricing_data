Built on an enterprise-grade secure platform, Azure AD B2C is a highly-available global service scaling to millions of identities.\n\nExplore pricing options\n-----------------------\n\nApply filters to customize pricing options to your needs.\n\nPrices are estimates only and are not intended as actual price quotes. Actual pricing may vary depending on the type of agreement entered with Microsoft, date of purchase, and the currency exchange rate. Prices are calculated based on US dollars and converted using London closing spot rates that are captured in the two business days prior to the last business day of the previous month end. If the two business days prior to the end of the month fall on a bank holiday in major markets, the rate setting day is generally the day immediately preceding the two business days. This rate applies to all transactions during the upcoming month. Sign in to the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) to see pricing based on your current program/offer with Microsoft. Contact an [Azure sales specialist](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/pricing/) for more information on pricing or to request a price quote.

Benefit from a free tier and flexible, predictable pricing for external users:\n\n*   Free goes further: Your first 50,000 MAUs per month are free for both Premium P1 and Premium P2 features.\n*   Flexible: Connect with customers and partners based on the usage and features you need, rather than the licenses you have.\n*   Predictable: Pay only for what you use. Forecast with ease as your business and usage scales. Customers are not charged for a MAU\u2019s subsequent authentications or for storing inactive users within that calendar month.\n\nAzure AD B2C is billed starting at the following rates, including for Enterprise Agreement customers. Premium P2 features include all the Premium P1 features and market-leading Identity Protection and Identity Governance controls, such as risk-based Conditional Access policies and Identity Protection reporting for Azure AD B2C.\n\n|  | Premium P1 | Premium P2 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| First 50,000 MAUs | $-/Monthly Active Users | $-/Monthly Active Users |\n| More than 50,000 MAUs | $-/Monthly Active Users | $-/Monthly Active Users |\n\n|  | Price |\n| --- | --- |\n| SMS Phone Authentication | Low-cost countries $-/verification attempt1 |\n| Medium low-cost countries $-/verification attempt1 |\n| Medium high-cost countries $-/verification attempt1 |\n| High-cost countries $-/verification attempt1 |\n\n11 transaction = 1 SMS Phone Auth verification attempt.

Internal employee users are not eligible and must have an [Azure AD license](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/azure-active-directory-pricing).\n    \n*   How is multi-factor authentication (MFA) billed?\n    \n    If you choose to provide higher levels of assurance using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Voice and SMS, you will continue to be charged a worldwide flat fee of $- for each MFA attempt that month, whether the log in is successful or unsuccessful. The worldwide flat rate provides greater predictability, by removing the price variations for SMS messages that are dependent on the telecom carrier or destination phone number. For example, if you have 100 monthly active users (MAUs) who make two MFA attempts that month, you would be billed $-, in addition to your usage: 100 MAUs x 2 MFA attempts/each = 200 MFA attempts x $-/attempt = $-\n    \n*   Can I enable Premium P1 features for some users, and Premium P2 features for others?\n    \n    All MAUs will be billed at the selected tier\u2019s pricing. To learn about which features are suitable for your needs, please contact your partner or Microsoft representative.\n    \n*   Do I need to have an Azure AD Premium P2 license to enable Premium P2 features for my external users?\n    \n    No, you are not required to purchase Premium P2 licenses for employees in order to provide Active Directory B2C at Premium P2 to external users. You may need to purchase at least one Azure AD Premium P2 license for your admin to enable and manage Premium P2 features.\n    \n*   Why does Azure AD B2C use a MAU-based billing model?\n    \n    We worked closely with our customers to develop flexible, predictable, and cost-efficient billing that reflects the usage and features you need, rather than the licenses you have.\n    \n    With 50,000 free MAUs at every tier, the vast majority of customers are able to use Azure AD B2C for free. Incremental pricing for our Premium P1 and Premium P2 features enables organizations the flexibility to offer world-class security to any user, without needing to purchase more Azure AD licenses. All customers benefit from more accurate forecasting, with predictable month-to-month charges.\n    \n*   Load more FAQ\n*   Who is considered a \u201cmonthly active user\u201d (MAU)?\n    \n    A monthly active user (MAU) is a unique user that performs an authentication within a given month. For example, a user that authenticates multiple times within a given month is counted as one MAU. Customers are not charged for a MAU\u2019s subsequent authentications during the month, nor for inactive users.\n    \n*   What is considered an authentication?\n    \n    Authentications may include:\n    \n    *   Active, interactive login by the user;\n    *   Passive, non-interactive login (such as single sign-on, sign-up, sign-in, token refresh, and password change)\n    \n    Additional operations that are counted as an authentication include: login to a portal; redeeming an invitation; authenticating to perform an admin action; and when an application exchanges a refresh token for a new identity token or access token for that user.\n    \n*   I have specific questions about my Enterprise Agreement.\n    \n    Enterprise Agreement customers are eligible to switch to MAU-based billing, with 50,000 free MAUs at any tier and a low, flat rate for incremental MAU.
