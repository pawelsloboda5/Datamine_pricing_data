notifications, web push, embeds, analytics, A/B testing, and more). You can also request our team to start a trial for the Intelligence plan, giving you access to AI recommendations and the Experiments platform. The 14-day trial for the Intelligence plan can be started independently of the Essential plan trial.\n    \n*   How do you calculate page views?\n    \n    A pageview occurs when a user visits a page on your website. That\u2019s exactly how we count: one pageview is counted each time a page of your website is loaded by a visitor.\n    \n*   What happens if I reach my plan\u2019s limits?\n    \n    No worries. We\u2019ll notify you when you reach 90% of your plan\u2019s pageviews. Once the limit is hit, the campaigns will be paused, so you won\u2019t get any unexpected charges. From there, you can upgrade or reactivate at any time.\n    \n*   What if I want to change plans?\n    \n    No problem. Just log in to Wisepops and click on your account picture. Choose **Change plan** in the menu that appears.\n    \n*   I want to have a custom integration with my CRM. Can you do it for me?\n    \n    Yes, custom CRM integration is a part of our Enterprise plan. Users of other plans can connect Wisepops with their tech stack through Zapier or our [native integrations](https://wisepops.com/integrations/). If you need details on custom integrations, [get in touch with us](https://wisepops.com/contact-us)[.](https://wisepops.com/contact-us)\n    \n*   How can I pay for Wisepops?\n    \n    We accept major credit cards through a secure payment processor: Stripe. You can pay monthly or choose an annual subscription with a proper discount (2 months are for free). Of course, there\u2019s a 14-day unlimited free trial to help you choose.\n    \n*   Do I need technical knowledge to install and use Wisepops?\n    \n    All you need to do is add a setup code to your website, so no major technical skills are needed. Using Wisepops does not require any knowledge, so you can easily build and run your campaigns. Should you need any help, visit our [Knowledge Base](https://support.wisepops.com/) or get in touch with our team.\n    \n*   I'm just getting started. Do you offer any helpful training, coaching, or extra support?\n    \n    Absolutely! As a new user of Wisepops, you're never alone in your journey to create engaging onsite marketing campaigns. Here's what we offer to help you get started and succeed:\n    \n    *   **Wisepops Community Access**: Upon signing up for Wisepops, you'll be welcomed into our private community. It's a space where you can engage with a diverse network of Wisepops users, exchange ideas, and learn from shared experiences.\n        \n    \n    *   **Helpcenter and Tutorials**: We provide a range of tutorials in our Helpcenter that are designed to equip you with practical skills and knowledge for designing effective pop-ups. Whether you're a beginner or looking to advance your skills, our tutorials cater to all levels.\n        \n    \n    *   **Weekly Coaching Sessions**: Our weekly coaching sessions are led by seasoned Wisepops professionals. These sessions are an opportunity for you to receive guidance, ask questions, and gain insights specific to your needs.\n        \n    \n    Once you sign up for Wisepops, you'll receive an email within minutes detailing how to access all these resources. We're committed to providing the support and tools you need to create impactful and high-converting marketing campaigns.\n    \n*   How do I choose the right plan for my business?\n    \n    We base our pricing on the number of pageviews as well as customer support access.\n    \n    Example: the 50K and 100K pageviews plans include support via AI support bot, Help Center, and the Wisepops community forum while the 250K and 500K plans add chat support. The 1M pageviews plan also includes a personalized onboarding session. The Enterprise plan adds technical support and strategy calls.\n    \n    But regardless of the plan you choose, you get all our features along with unlimited campaigns and users.\n    \n*   How do support access plans differ?\n    \n    Our support access plans are tailored to cater to a variety of needs, whether you're just starting out or operating at a large scale.

notifications, web push, embeds, analytics, A/B testing, and more). You can also request our team to start a trial for the Intelligence plan, giving you access to AI recommendations and the Experiments platform. The 14-day trial for the Intelligence plan can be started independently of the Essential plan trial.\n    \n*   How do you calculate page views?\n    \n    A pageview occurs when a user visits a page on your website. That\u2019s exactly how we count: one pageview is counted each time a page of your website is loaded by a visitor.\n    \n*   What happens if I reach my plan\u2019s limits?\n    \n    No worries. We\u2019ll notify you when you reach 90% of your plan\u2019s pageviews. Once the limit is hit, the campaigns will be paused, so you won\u2019t get any unexpected charges. From there, you can upgrade or reactivate at any time.\n    \n*   What if I want to change plans?\n    \n    No problem. Just log in to Wisepops and click on your account picture. Choose **Change plan** in the menu that appears.\n    \n*   I want to have a custom integration with my CRM. Can you do it for me?\n    \n    Yes, custom CRM integration is a part of our Enterprise plan. Users of other plans can connect Wisepops with their tech stack through Zapier or our [native integrations](https://wisepops.com/integrations/). If you need details on custom integrations, [get in touch with us](https://wisepops.com/contact-us)[.](https://wisepops.com/contact-us)\n    \n*   How can I pay for Wisepops?\n    \n    We accept major credit cards through a secure payment processor: Stripe. You can pay monthly or choose an annual subscription with a proper discount (2 months are for free). Of course, there\u2019s a 14-day unlimited free trial to help you choose.\n    \n*   Do I need technical knowledge to install and use Wisepops?\n    \n    All you need to do is add a setup code to your website, so no major technical skills are needed. Using Wisepops does not require any knowledge, so you can easily build and run your campaigns. Should you need any help, visit our [Knowledge Base](https://support.wisepops.com/) or get in touch with our team.\n    \n*   I'm just getting started.
