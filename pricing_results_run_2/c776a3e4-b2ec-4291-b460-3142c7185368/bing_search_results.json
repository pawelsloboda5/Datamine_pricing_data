That means we\u2019ve seen businesses like yours before, and we\u2019re here to help.\n\nMeg McMillan\n\nMeg Marie Photography\n\n[Get started for free chevronRight-inline icon](https://app.podia.com/signup)\n\n### Is it easy to change plans?\n\nIt sure is. You can upgrade, downgrade, or switch from monthly to annual billing at any time.\n\n### I tried Podia and it wasn't for me. Can I have a refund?\n\nWe offer a free trial so that you can take Podia for a spin! If you sign up for a paid plan and would like a refund, please contact us within 72 hours after your monthly (or annual) renewal or upgrade, and we\u2019ll be happy to refund the most recent payment.\n\nNote: we do not offer pro-rated refunds for annual payments. Refunds take 5-10 business days to process.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to cancel your plan, you can do so at any time. Just login to your Podia account, go to \u201caccount settings\u201d and visit the \u201cbilling\u201d section to cancel.\n\n### Are there any transaction fees or payment processing fees?\n\nOn the Mover plan, we charge a 5% transaction fee. There are no Podia fees on the Shaker plan.\n\nYour payment processor (Stripe or PayPal) will charge a standard transaction fee of 2.9% + 30\u00a2, which may vary based on your location. The fees are charged by the processor and are not associated with Podia.\n\n### Can I buy Podia Email without buying a Mover or Shaker plan?\n\nYou need a Mover or Shaker plan to use Podia Email beyond your 30-day free trial. All Podia plans and the free trial come with Podia Email free for up to 100 subscribers. After your free trial ends, you'll need to pick either a Mover or Shaker plan to continue using Podia Email, and you can always add on more subscribers as your list grows.\n\n### What happens when I reach the subscriber limit of my Podia Email plan?\n\nYou will receive a notification email as you approach the maximum number of subscribers for your plan. Once the limit is reached, you will be able to upgrade to the next plan tier for more subscribers. You will never be upgraded automatically, and you can downgrade to a lower plan tier whenever you want!\n\n### How do product and course migrations work?\n\nThe number of products we can migrate depends on your plan.  \n\\- Mover: 20 products  \n\\- Shaker: 30 products\n\nHere's what we can migrate for you:  \n\\-Online course content, including files and text  \n\\-Digital downloads, including files and text  \n\\-All online course and digital download customer email addresses  \n\\-All free community/membership subscribers\n\nIf you need more products imported, send us a message at hello@podia.com to discuss your options.\n\nFind the Podia pricing plan that's right for your business. Start with a free forever plan and upgrade as your business grows.",
