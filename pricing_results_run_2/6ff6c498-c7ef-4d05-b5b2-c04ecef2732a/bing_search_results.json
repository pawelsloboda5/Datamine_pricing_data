Zapier makes it easy for you to move data between your apps without being a developer. We may need you to locate information for certain accounts, but we'll guide you through any additional steps. Our Support champions are also here to help you via email should you need assistance.\n\nWhat are apps?\n\nAn app is a web service or application, such as [Google Docs](https://zapier.com/apps/google-docs/integrations), [Evernote](https://zapier.com/apps/evernote/integrations), or [Salesforce](https://zapier.com/apps/salesforce/integrations). Zapier offers integrations for more than 7,000 apps and helps you easily move data between them to automate repetitive tasks. [Premium apps](https://zapier.com/apps?filter=premium) are select apps exclusively available to users on paid Zapier plans.\n\nWhat is a Zap?\n\nA Zap is an automated workflow that connects your apps and services together. Each Zap consists of a trigger and one or more actions. When you turn your Zap on, it will run the action steps every time the trigger event occurs.\n\nWhat are tasks?\n\nA task is counted every time a Zap successfully moves data or completes an action for you automatically. For example, if your Zap has an action to create new Google Contacts, each contact created will use one task. If the action isn't successfully completed, it doesn't count against your task limit.\n\nWhat is a trigger?\n\nA trigger is an event that starts a Zap. Once you turn on a Zap, Zapier will monitor for that trigger event. For example, if you create a Zap that sends a message to a rep each time you get a new lead, the trigger is a new lead entering your lead management app. Triggers don't count toward your task limit.\n\nWhat's the difference between Zaps, triggers, actions, and tasks?\n\nZap is our term for the automated workflows you set up to connect your apps. A trigger is the event that starts your Zap. Actions are events that happen automatically after your Zap is triggered. For example, in a Zap that sends a message to a Sales rep each time you get a new lead, the trigger is the new lead entering your lead management app, and the action is the Slack notification sent with the new lead's info.\n\nWhen Zapier performs an action successfully, it counts as a task. Each successful action in a Zap counts as a separate task.\n\nDoes checking (or polling) for new data use tasks?\n\nZapier never charges you a task to check for new data\u2014only when a Zap successfully completes an action for you.\n\nFor instance, say you want an automated workflow to check\u2014or poll\u2014your Dropbox account every five minutes for new files. Then, if a new file appears, the workflow will send you a Slack message. In this case, sending the Slack message about the new Dropbox file counts as a task.\n\nHow many tasks do I need?\n\nThe number of tasks you need depends on the number of active Zaps you have and how frequently those Zaps run to automate your work. The more actions your Zaps complete, the more tasks you'll need.\n\nBut don't worry! When you reach your plan\u2019s task limit, we'll notify you via email. When you reach your plan\u2019s task limit, we'll also switch you to [pay-per-task billing](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/15279018245901#h_01HKCH7TXPGX4SZBRP521QYY5Y).\n\nWhat happens if I hit my task limit?\n\nWe'll email you when you reach your plan's task limit. Once you've reached that limit, we'll switch you to pay-per-task billing at a rate of 1.25x the cost of a base task on your subscription so your Zaps continue running.\n\nWhen you're on pay-per-task billing, we\u2019ll email you if you\u2019re close to your plan\u2019s maximum task limit (3x your task subscription) and then again when you reach it. Once you\u2019ve reached your maximum task limit, your Zaps will pause until the start of your next pay period.\n\nYou can [learn more about task overages here](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/15279018245901-Metered-tasks-in-Zapier). Our [Sales team](https://zapier.com/l/contact-sales?demo_source=pricing-logged-out_faq_section) is also available to help you choose the right plan for your business.\n\nWill I be charged a task for any of Zapier\u2019s built-in data tools?\n\nZapier offers a variety of [built-in data tools in the App Directory](https://zapier.com/apps/categories/zapier-tools) that help you add conditional filter and path logic, and format data. The following steps don't count as a task:\n\n*   Zapier Tables\n*   Zapier Interfaces\n*   Filter by Zapier\n*   Formatter by Zapier\n*   Path by Zapier\n*   Delay, Looping, Sub-Zap, Digest, Zapier Manager, Storage\n\nHow many connections does Zapier support?\n\nZapier connects to 7,000+ apps, more than any other automation tool. If you want to connect your internal tools, you can build your own private integration with our easy-to-use\u00a0[developer platform](https://developer.zapier.com/).\n\n### Plans and payments\n\nShould I use the Team or Enterprise plan?\n\nThe Team plan provides features that facilitate collaboration on automation across several groups or teams. These features include shared app connections and a shared workspace.\n\nThe Enterprise plan enables your entire team to use Zapier, with advanced security features, governance, and monitoring features such as advanced admin permissions and custom data retention. Enterprise allows you to empower all of your employees while providing safeguards you need to protect sensitive data and critical workflows.\n\nWhich plans allow for unlimited users?\n\nUnlimited users are available only on the Enterprise plan.\n\nDo you have a free trial of your premium features?\n\nYes! When you create a new Zapier account, you're instantly enrolled in a\u00a0[free 14-day trial](https://zapier.com/help/account/billing-pricing/understand-your-free-zapier-trial)\u00a0of the Zapier Professional plan. No credit card required.\n\nPlease [contact our Sales team](https://zapier.com/l/contact-sales?demo_source=pricing-logged-out_faq_section) if you want to enroll in a free trial of the Zapier Team and Enterprise plans to experience our most advanced collaboration features and admin controls.\n\nCan I change my plan later?\n\nYes, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. If you upgrade, the change happens immediately, and you'll only pay a prorated amount for the rest of the billing cycle. If you choose to downgrade, it'll take effect at the end of that billing cycle.\n\nWhat if I decide to cancel?\n\nIf you no longer wish to use Zapier, you may cancel at any time. You'll still have access to your paid plan for the remainder of your billing cycle. See also our [refund policy](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496260621197-Zapier-s-refund-policy) here.\n\nDo you offer any discounts?\n\nYes! When you choose to pre-pay for a year of service, you'll receive a discount compared to monthly payments. Please see the pricing details above.\n\nWe also offer an additional 15% discount for non-profits. Learn more\u00a0[here](https://zapier.com/non-profits/).\n\nCan you charge me in my local currency?\n\nYes, we currently accept payment in multiple currencies with more currencies being added soon. You can see a list all of our accepted payment methods and currencies\u00a0[here](https://zapier.com/help/account/billing-pricing/charging-in-local-currency).\n\nCan I pay via invoice or wire transfer?\n\nYou can pay via invoice or wire transfer if you are on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, visit [Zapier for Enterprise](https://zapier.com/enterprise).\n\n### Sales and support\n\nDo you have a Sales team?\n\nYes, you can [contact our Sales team](https://zapier.com/l/contact-sales?demo_source=pricing-logged-out_faq_section) to book a demo for our Professional, Team, and Enterprise plans.\n\nWhat level of support do Team and Enterprise plans get?\n\nTeam and Enterprise plans get Premier Support, which provides faster, prioritized responses from our dedicated Premier Support team.\n\nOn top of Premier Support, the Enterprise plan gives you a customized onboarding program, a Technical Account Manager, and a Customer Success Manager to help answer questions and work with your team in building advanced workflows.\n\nWhat if I have more questions?\n\nTry searching for what you need in our\u00a0[Help and Support](https://zapier.com/support/)\u00a0site.
