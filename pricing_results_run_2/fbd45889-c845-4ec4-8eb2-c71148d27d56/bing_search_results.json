For example, if you create an account on the 10th of January, your first usage period runs from the 10th of January to the 9th of February, and the second usage period runs from the 10th of February to the 9th of March, and so on.  \n  \nIf you upgrade your account to a paid plan, the day of the month that your account renews becomes the day that your usage period resets. For example, if you create an account on the 10th of January, and you upgrade your account on the 20th of January, your usage period now runs from from the 20th of January to the 19th of February, and your second usage period will run from the 20th of February to the 19th of March. If your account downgrades automatically, you will retain this usage period until you upgrade again.\n\nWhat is limited usage?\n\nEach pricing plan includes limits for the amount of usage allowed in a given month. If your plan reaches a limit, it will trigger an action in our system. The Hobby plan has a 'hard limit' which means that when a limit has been reached, the functionality which exceeded the limit will become unavailable for the rest of the month. We recommend that you use the Hobby plan to try out AddEvent's tools, and then upgrade to the right paid plan for you based upon your use-case and usage needs.\n\nWhat is a soft/hard limit?\n\nEach pricing plan includes limits for the amount of usage allowed in a given month. If your plan reaches a limit, it will trigger an action in our system. The Hobby plan has a 'hard limit' which means that when a limit has been reached, the functionality which exceeded the limit will become unavailable for the rest of the month. All paid plans have 'soft limits' which means that when a limit has been reached, our system will notify the account admin and request that you upgrade your account, but you will not automatically lose any of your plan's functionality.\n\nWhat is an event-add?\n\nOur system records an 'event-add' each time someone clicks an \"add to calendar\" button or link to add your event to their calendar, and our servers receive that request. Event-adds are counted for all of the event sharing methods included in the Dashboard, and for automated add to calendar buttons and links. Note that event-adds are counted for events, and not for calendar subscriptions. For example, if you have a calendar with 5 events on it, a user subscribing to that calendar would count as 1 subscriber and 0 event-adds.\n\nWhat is a subscriber?\n\nSubscription calendars are calendars that you create (and share) via the AddEvent Dashboard that can contain multiple events. Your users can subscribe (or follow) these calendars to add all of the events contained within them to their personal calendars. When your users subscribe, they become 'subscribers', and a dynamic connection is created between AddEvent and their chosen calendar system. This dynamic connection means that when you add, delete or change an event in the AddEvent subscription calendar you've created, that change will be reflected (after a short delay) on its subscribers' personal calendars.\n\nCan an account be shared?\n\nYes! You can add other individuals from your organization as users on your account so that you can collaborate on creating, managing, and sharing your events and calendars. You can invite new users and manage permissions for existing users from the Users page once you log in to the AddEvent app.  \n  \nYou can see the number of Account Users available on each plan on the Plans and Pricing page or, if you already have an account, on your Usage page. Need more Account Users than the Professional plan? Please reach out to our sales team to discuss an Enterprise plan with a custom number of Account Users.\n\nDo you offer any discounts to non-profits?\n\nWe are pleased to support non-profits with custom discounts.
