Best of the best.\u201d\n\n![Image 87: indoor2](https://cdn.waiverforever.com/wf-assets/2025-04-11/b6f94a3/assets/img/indoor2.78321758.png)\n\n\u201cWe love the ability to customize our waivers. Waiver Forever has made our intake process better. I love the ability to analyze our data by date range.\u201d\n\n![Image 88: outdoor4](https://cdn.waiverforever.com/wf-assets/2025-04-11/b6f94a3/assets/img/outdoor4.5be4c503.png)\n\n\u201cWe love the easy signing from multiple devices and the up-to-date list of signed names. Our events are run by various people at various times, not a central location. We can all check the list of signed people and get anyone without a waiver quickly signed from phones or iPads, or have participants pre-sign on their own.\u201d\n\n![Image 89: outdoor15](blob:http://localhost/552b7b6fe40caa87b38168cf4c0fe175)\n\n\u201cWe love the ability to scan a driver's license to capture information. It saves considerable time! During the weekends, we are so incredibly busy. Every second saved counts and allows us to provide a better experience for our customers.\u201d\n\n![Image 90: outdoor13](https://cdn.waiverforever.com/wf-assets/2025-04-11/b6f94a3/assets/img/outdoor13.e727724f.png)\n\n\u201cWe use WaiverForever primarily for our test rides in our store or during the events. WaiverForever does a great job because we can literally just have iPad with account login and we could go anywhere without paper printed. Also it allows us easy to collect customer contact information so we can organize and learn from them.\u201d\n\n![Image 91: beauty3](https://cdn.waiverforever.com/wf-assets/2025-04-11/b6f94a3/assets/img/beauty3.96d909fa.png)\n\n\u201cThere are several features I'd love for you to have. Online Storage which stores all the information I need, client/customer Profiles that we could save their ID and history in, and simply search by last name to find again would be amazing.\u201d\n\n![Image 92: beauty5](https://cdn.waiverforever.com/wf-assets/2025-04-11/b6f94a3/assets/img/beauty5.3cc08246.png)\n\n\u201cWe love not having to use paper. We had hundreds of waivers in a folder with lots of good data but no way to correlate. Now that they are digital we are getting waivers signed and able to comb through analytics to get useful data about our customers, where they come from, and why they use our service.\u201d\n\nGet WaiverForever to Streamline Your Business\n---------------------------------------------\n\nTry for free\n\n*   No Credit Card Needed\n*   Mostly used digital waiver solution\n*   Free [Starter Plan](https://www.waiverforever.com/free-plan) Forever\n\nIndustries\n\n[Events, Expos, Parties](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/events-expos-parties)\n\n[Spa, Salon, Skincare](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/spa-salon-tattoo-piercing-beauty)\n\n[Kids' Activities](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/playgrounds-kids-activities)\n\n[Escape Room, Paddleboards](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/escape-room-adventure-park)\n\n[Water Parks, Pools, Float spas](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/water-parks-floating-studio)\n\n[Bike Shops, Moto Riding](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/bikes-moto-riding-automotive)\n\n[Tours, RV Rentals](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/tours-rv-rentals-campgrounds)\n\n[Sports, Gym, Fitness](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/sports-gym-fitness-yoga-movement-arts)\n\n[Shooting Ranges](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/paintball-gun-shooting-ranges)\n\n[Production, 3D Print](https://www.waiverforever.com/industries/production-3d-print-video-and-photo)\n\n[Waiverforever vs Docusign](https://www.waiverforever.com/waiverforever-vs-docusign)\n\n[Waiverforever vs SmartWaiver](https://www.waiverforever.com/waiverforever-vs-smartwaiver)\n\n[Release of Liability Form](https://www.waiverforever.com/release-of-liability)\n\nUsing WaiverForever\n\n[AI Generator](https://www.waiverforever.com/ai-generator)\n\n[Product Features](https://www.waiverforever.com/features)\n\n[Template Gallery](https://www.waiverforever.com/templates)\n\n[Digital Signature](https://www.waiverforever.com/digital-signature)\n\n[Compliance](https://www.waiverforever.com/compliance)\n\n[Online PDF Mapping](https://www.waiverforever.com/pdf-mapping)\n\n[Request & Assign Forms](https://www.waiverforever.com/request-support)\n\n[Free Plan](https://www.waiverforever.com/free-plan)\n\n[App](https://www.waiverforever.com/app)\n\n[Pricing](https://www.waiverforever.com/pricing)\n\n[FAQ](https://www.waiverforever.com/support)\n\n[Enterprise](https://www.waiverforever.com/enterprise)\n\n[Developer](https://www.waiverforever.com/developer)\n\n[Affiliate Program](https://www.waiverforever.com/affiliate-program)\n\n[API Documentation](https://ariesapp.github.io/open-api-doc/)\n\n[Terms and Conditions](https://www.waiverforever.com/terms)\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.waiverforever.com/privacy)\n\nHandy Links\n\n[Download iPhone/iPad App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waiverforever/id534978891?mt=8)\n\n[Download Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ariesapp.waiverforever)\n\n[Blog](https://blog.waiverforever.com/)\n\n[![Image 93: Read WaiverForever reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/waiverforever/widgets/stars?color=white&type=read)](https://www.g2.com/products/waiverforever/reviews?utm_source=review-widget \"Read reviews of WaiverForever on G2\")\n\n\u00a92009~2025 Aries App Inc., all rights reserved.\n\nContact usTry our demo waiver\n\nPlease enter your email\n\nYou are registering with our [Starter Plan](https://www.waiverforever.com/free-plan)\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.waiverforever.com/terms)\n\ncontinue\n\n![Image 94: send via emails](https://cdn.waiverforever.com/wf-assets/2025-04-11/b6f94a3/assets/img/email.162ab7cb.svg)\n\nWe have sent you a registration email to . please follow the link in the email to complete your registration.\n\n[Already have an account?
