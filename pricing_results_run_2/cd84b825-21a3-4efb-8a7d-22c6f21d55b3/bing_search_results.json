As an association of more than 4,000 members, we wanted an elegant solution that would allow us to restrict content, manage memberships, and integrate with a variety of other WordPress plugins for Events, CRM, and LMS.\n\nThe migration was easy and doing custom dev has been smooth and seamless.\n\n \n\nRating: 5 out of 5\n\n  \n\n**PMPro is the best way to protect your content and provide a smooth experience for your users.** We are a yoga video streaming company that offers monthly and annual memberships. Our customer base has grown 10x thanks to the membership power and versatility of PMPro. It was a breeze to integrate PMPro with the dozens of official and third-party Add Ons.\n\n![Image 4: 100% Money Back Guarantee](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/images/money-back-guarantee.png)\n\nTry Our Premium Plans Risk Free.\n--------------------------------\n\nYour purchase is backed by a 100 day money-back guarantee.\n\nIf you decide not to use your premium plan, request a full refund\u2014no questions asked.

Paid Memberships Pro is 100% open source \u2013 there is no limit on how many sites you can use our plugin on. A PMPro License is required for automatic updates for our Standard and Plus Add Ons. A Standard license key can be used on 1 site, a Plus license key can be used on 2 sites. [Contact us](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/contact/) if you are interested in using a single license on more than 2 sites.\n\n**How does PMPro compare to other membership plugins for WordPress?**\n\nOur free plan is better than everyone else\u2019s paid plan. Unlike other plugins that charge for the software and include support for free, we make our software available to everyone at no cost. Our paid plans add services and expert support to help you build a successful membership site. We are fully committed to open source and continuously invest in improving our software. Our support team goes beyond quick replies\u2014we take the time to provide real solutions and respond within one business day. View our [Product Comparison blog posts](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/category/product-comparison/).\n\n**If the software is free, how does PMPro make money?**\n\nWe have paid plans that include automatic updates, premium support, and exclusive members-only content. If you are wondering how we can sustain a free product, the answer is that we have been in business and profitable for over 15 years, continuously improving PMPro and supporting thousands of membership sites. Our business model ensures we can keep offering a free version while also providing premium options.\n\n****Which plan should I choose?****\n\nWe currently offer three plans: Free, Standard, and Plus. Each is tailored to different needs, from membership site beginners to individual business owners to web developers and agencies. We put together a [full guide on selecting the right plan based on your membership site needs](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/paid-memberships-pro-plans/). If your needs change in the future, you can upgrade at any time. Nothing will change with your site settings, content, user and member information, or subscriptions.\n\n****How much support can I expect to receive?****\n\nWe provide very deep support and are able to troubleshoot most issues via the support forums. Some custom code is straight forward, and we can assist with writing the code and instructing you on exactly where to put it. If you have found a tutorial on our site about a customization, we can usually help you to set that customization up or tweak it in small ways.\n\n****Does Paid Memberships Pro do \\[this special thing\\]?****\n\nIf you have questions about a specific feature or requirement, [use our contact form for pre-sales questions](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/contact/). If you purchase now to ask in our support forums, and we are not able to give you the direction you need, you can ask for a refund within 30 days.\n\n****Does your plugin include integration for \\[my preferred payment gateway\\]?****\n\n[View our gateway documentation](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/gateway/) to see which gateways are included in the core plugin. There are also [several additional gateways available as free plugins](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-on-category/payment/) listed in our Add Ons page. Developing a new gateway plugin is a large undertaking. [This page includes a general guide](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/gateway/adding-a-new-gateway/) to developing a new gateway and is meant for experienced developers. We are not currently taking on any new gateway development work, but we will support other developers who are working on gateway integrations via the support area or in Slack.\n\n**Do I need to know any coding to use this plugin?**\n\nNo, Paid Memberships Pro does not require any coding knowledge. The plugin is designed to meet all levels of WordPress experience. At the same time, our plugin is very developer-friendly and extendible.\n\n****What happens if I do not renew (once my membership expires)?****\n\nMembership is valid for one year from purchase date. If your membership expires you will lose access to the support forum and any premium videos, tutorials, and code recipes. The core Paid Memberships Pro plugin and all Add Ons already installed will continue to work. The core Paid Memberships Pro plugin and other Add Ons we host in the WordPress.org repository can still be updated through the WordPress dashboard, but your License Key will not allow installation or updates to premium Add Ons.\n\n****Can I purchase Add Ons individually?****\n\nAdd Ons cannot be purchased individually. We designed these plans through our experience supporting thousands of membership sites on this platform for the over 10 years. As a fully open source WordPress plugin, you can [use our code for free](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/free/) if you cannot afford a membership or are just testing.\n\n****What if I have unique requirements and need more help?****\n\nSome customizations are so unique that you may need a developer. In cases where our support team cannot code a feature just for you, we will answer specific technical questions and provide broad guidance on how certain things could be developed. You should share this information with your developer or invite them to handle your support ticket. [You can find a developer here](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/developers/).\n\n****I\u2019m a developer. Can I use my PMPro License key on client sites?****\n\nYou are free to use your license key on client sites. However, we advise\u00a0developers to encourage each client to purchase their own plan. This allows clients to have access to the support forums and receive ongoing updates. In our experience, each site having a unique license key and support membership benefits both the site owner and the developer. This protects you if you need to cancel your own license in the future, want to end a relationship with a client, or if one of your clients shares your key and it gets flagged for abuse.\n\n****My theme included Paid Memberships Pro. How do I get support?****\n\nOur core plugin is 100% free and open source. Your theme author has decided to bundle our plugin in your theme download, but this does not include a support membership or access to our Add Ons. You must purchase a support membership that includes a license key in order to get support or access premium Add Ons.\n\n  \n\n**Recommended by top influencers, users, and web hosts**\n\nPlugin Reviews\n\n4.3 out of 5\n\n![Image 5: G2](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/G2-150x150.png)\n\n4.8 out of 5\n\n![Image 6: Capterra](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Capterra-300x67.png)\n\n5 out of 5\n\nPricing and plans for Paid Memberships Pro.
