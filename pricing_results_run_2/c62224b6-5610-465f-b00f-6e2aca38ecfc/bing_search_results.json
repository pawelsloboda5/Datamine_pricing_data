We got 'em\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n### How can I upgrade my account?\n\nYou can upgrade your account at any time to get more volume or more features (or both) from within your account settings.\n\n### How does Mailgun work?\n\nMailgun is an email delivery and deliverability service that empowers businesses to easily send email from their applications. We\u2019ve built a powerful, cloud-based infrastructure that scales gracefully and handles billions of emails per month so you don\u2019t have to deal with the complexity and hassle of maintaining your own servers. It\u2019s free to sign up and easy to get started. Read our docs for more info on how Mailgun works.\n\n### How does your billing work?\n\nUpon signup, you will only be billed the prorated amount of the selected plan for the current month. After that, your monthly plan cost and any extra emails and validations you use will be billed at the start of each month for the previous month. If you decide to cancel your account, any remaining balance due will be charged before the account can be closed.\n\n### How do I send my emails with Mailgun?\n\nSince Mailgun exposes both an HTTP API and an SMTP endpoint, you can choose to send the way you\u2019d like. Both ways have their advantages\u2026 SMTP is easy to setup and often plug and play, but API is much more reliable at scale. If you\u2019re building an application, we recommend using our HTTP API.\n\nOne thing to note: There\u2019s no send button in Mailgun, so if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, contact us and we\u2019ll point you in the right direction.\n\n### How many dedicated IPs do I need? Can I get more?\n\nWhile some customers are happy on our shared IPs, others prefer the benefit of dedicated IPs, which give you more control over your reputation and deliverability. One dedicated IP is included with Foundation 100k, Growth and Scale plans.\n\nThe number of dedicated IPs you need depends on your volume, the types of email you're sending, and your frequency. Considering no two senders are alike, it can be hard to give a blanket recommendation, but with [Mailgun Optimize's Deliverability Services](https://www.mailgun.com/solutions/email-deliverability-service/), your TAM can investigate and advise on the exact number and types of IPs that best suite your business. Otherwise, you can add additional IPs to your account for $59/IP/month from within the control panel or by contacting support.\n\n### How many users come with each plan?\n\nEvery Mailgun plan (except free and basic) allows you to add as many users as you need to your account at no additional cost. We find that this keeps people from sharing login credentials (a security no-no), and it makes you happy. Win win. You can also manage user permissions with our five user roles. Read more about our\u00a0[role-based access control](https://www.mailgun.com/blog/product/5-user-roles-access-control-permissions-mailgun-account/). Free plans are limited to 1 user per account.\n\n### I want to test out Mailgun first. How can I do that?\n\nThere are several ways to give Mailgun a try. First, our free plan allows you to explore the platform with all the fundamentals needed to start sending with a daily sending cap. If you\u2019re looking for something more, our paid plans offer free 30-day trials that provided unlimited access to higher tier features like:\n\n*   Ticket/Chat/Phone support, dependent on plan\n    \n*   Longer durations of log retention\n    \n*   Better account security with SAML SSO integration\n    \n\n*   deliv-team@mailgun.company\n*   outbound-sales@mailgun.company\n*   spamtrapmonitoring@mailgun.company\n*   iceman@mailgun.top\n*   admiral@mailgun.top\n*   timduncan@mailgun.top\n\n[](https://www.mailgun.com/)\n\nSubscribe to the Mailgun newsletter\n\nSend me the Mailgun newsletter.
