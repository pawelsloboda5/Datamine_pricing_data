You can take up to 100 screenshots of any URL for free per month, including rendering HTML and PDF.\n\nOnly successfully rendered screenshots are counted.\n\nOnly unique screenshots (unique combination of options) are counted that are not cached. However, we use CDN for caching, and if there is a cache miss, we might rerender the screenshot and count it against the monthly quota.\n\nYou will receive an email when you are at 90% and 100% usage of your monthly quota. Nevertheless, you can disable or enable these notifications if you wish.\n\nYes, included in every plan. Email us at support@screenshotone.com on what is missing and we will try to deliver as fast as possible.\n\nNo. Our payment processor, Paddle, handles all subscription management.\n\nYes, of course, you can do it anytime you wish. You need to navigate to the \"Subscription\" page and cancel your plan. You will no longer be charged, and you will be able to take screenshots until the end of the paid monthly limit.\n\nIf you are disappointed with your purchase for any reason, email us at support@screenshotone.com within 30 days, and we will refund you in full, no questions asked.\n\nScreenshotOne Pricing",
