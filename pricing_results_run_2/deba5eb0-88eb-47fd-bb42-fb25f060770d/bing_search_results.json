Runs seamlessly in the background. Easy to toggle on/off and adjust settings from the taskbar corner on windows. The two-way noise cancellation is a huge benefit, eliminating the distracting background noises of your non-krisp-using coworkers.\u201d\n\n**Eric Z.**  \n**Principal Owner**\n\n![Image 84: Harvey Jones](https://krisp.ai/wp-content/themes/krisp-v4/imgs/img_harvey.png)\n\n**Harvey Jones**  \n**Head of Workplace Collaboration**\n\n\u201cAtlassian staff working at home have benefitted from the Krisp service since early in the pandemic. Since our Team Anywhere announcement, we have sought ways to make remote and hybrid working more effective, and Krisp's ability to screen background noise from calls and recordings has been invaluable to many staff.\u201d\n\n**Harvey Jones**  \n**Head of Workplace Collaboration**\n\n![Image 85: Chad E.](https://krisp.ai/wp-content/themes/krisp-v4/imgs/img_chad.png)\n\n**Chad E.**  \n**Solutions Architect**\n\n\u201cWith a nice noise-canceling headset, you can remove those background noises coming from your side of the call for yourself, BUT, you still have to deal with the other sides of the calls, and Krisp lets you filter out those noises as well. No more Dog Barking in the background!\u201d\n\n**Chad E.**  \n**Solutions Architect**\n\n![Image 86: Isaac G.](https://krisp.ai/wp-content/themes/krisp-v4/imgs/img_isaac.png)\n\n**Isaac G.**  \n**Agile transformation coach**\n\n\u201cKrisp mutes the noise I don't want going into my call and always allows me to be heard. I have crying kids in the background, noisy house stuff, noises from my computer and none of them ever get on the call. Bonus points for being able to mute the backgrounds of others on the call if their environment is noisy.\u201d\n\n**Isaac G.**  \n**Agile transformation coach**\n\n![Image 87: Go to previous slide](https://krisp.ai/wp-content/themes/krisp-v4/imgs/icon_slider_prev.svg)\n\n![Image 88: Go to next slide](https://krisp.ai/wp-content/themes/krisp-v4/imgs/icon_slider_next.svg)\n\n### Ready to get started?\n\nWith Krisp, you and your team will have more productive and engaging online meetings\u2014without all the distractions.\n\n![Image 89: Green check mark](blob:http://localhost/f85498d7c80413e296759cb29af7206e)For individuals and small teams ![Image 90: Green check mark](blob:http://localhost/f85498d7c80413e296759cb29af7206e)No credit card required\n\n![Image 91: Green check mark](blob:http://localhost/f85498d7c80413e296759cb29af7206e)For enterprise and call centers\n\nLooking for Krisp's pricing and plans information?
