Amazon is our hosting partner, and our servers are hosted in a world-class data center with the most advanced [security](https://databox.com/security-policy) protocols. Read more about how we protect and ensure the [privacy of your data](https://databox.com/security-policy).\n\nCan I upgrade and downgrade at any time?\n\nAbsolutely. Our flexible payment plans allow you to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at any time. When upgrading, you\u2019re only responsible for the difference in cost between your current plan and your new plan. When downgrading, your plan changes immediately and you\u2019ll receive a credit applied to future payments covering the difference in cost between the current plan and the new plan. Cancellations take effect at the end of your billing period.\n\nDo you offer a yearly discount?\n\nYes. Upgrade to a yearly subscription and get 20% off.\n\nWhich payment methods do you accept?\n\nYou can pay for your subscription using Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, American Express, JCB, Discover, Diners Club, Union Pay, and Google Pay. Annual subscriptions can be billed with other payment methods (wire bank transfer, checks,...). Contact us for more information.\n\nWhat happens after my free trial?\n\nDuring the 14-day trial, you can purchase a paid plan and your first payment will be at the end of the trial period. If you do not purchase, the trial will simply expire and you\u2019ll be prompted to continue on the Free Plan. We do not require a credit card to start a trial.\n\nWhat if I exceed my plan's limits?\n\nNo problem, we will automatically notify you within the app when you run into a limit for your plan. Common limits you get notified of are the number of users, dashboards, data sources, custom metrics, and when trying to use certain advanced features not included in your Plan.\n\nHow can I cancel my subscription?\n\nYou can cancel your subscription at any time from the bottom section on the Plans or Billing page. Our support team can help if you just need to pause your account temporarily.\n\nWhat support resources are available to me?\n\nWorld-class support is included in all plans! Everyone gets access to:\n\n*   Our Support Team - just start a chat with us\n*   [Help Center](https://help.databox.com/).\n\nWhat currency is used for billing?\n\nAll prices listed are shown in US dollars (USD).\n\nWhat is the difference between a Data source and a Connection?\n\nA Connection refers to the integration you set up to bring in data from a specific service or tool, such as Google Analytics.\n\nA Data source is a specific dataset or view within that Connection. For instance, in Google Analytics, a Data source would be a particular website property like a specific website's domain.\n\nOne Connection can encompass multiple Data sources. So, while you have a single connection to Google Analytics, you can access and use data from multiple properties (domains) within that Connection.\n\n### Build your first dashboard in 5 minutes or less\n\n[Try It, Free](https://databox.com/signup) [Book A Demo](https://databox.com/demo)\n\n**Latest from our blog**\n\n*   [Playmaker Spotlight: Peter Pogladi\u010d, Engineering Manager](https://databox.com/devops-playmaker-spotlight-peter-pogladic-engineering-manager)  \n    April 10, 2025\n*   [Becoming an AI-First Company](https://databox.com/becoming-an-ai-first-company)  \n    April 7, 2025\n\n**Product**\n\n*   [Overview](https://databox.com/product)\n*   [Metrics & KPIs](https://databox.com/metric-kpi-software)\n*   [Dashboards](https://databox.com/dashboard-software)\n*   [Reports](https://databox.com/report-software)\n*   [Benchmarks](https://databox.com/benchmark-software)\n*   [Forecasts](https://databox.com/forecast-software)\n*   [Automation](https://databox.com/performance-management-software)\n*   [Goals](https://databox.com/goal-software)\n\n**Compare**\n\n*   [vs. Tableau](https://databox.com/tableau-alternative)\n*   [vs. Looker Studio](https://databox.com/looker-studio-alternative)\n*   [vs. Klipfolio](https://databox.com/klipfolio-alternative)\n*   [vs. Power BI](https://databox.com/power-bi-alternative)\n*   [vs. Whatagraph](https://databox.com/whatagraph-alternative)\n*   [vs. AgencyAnalytics](https://databox.com/agencyanalytics-alternative)\n*   [vs. DashThis](https://databox.com/dashthis-alternative)\n\n**Company**\n\n*   [About](https://databox.com/about)\n*   [Careers](https://databox.com/careers)\n*   [Product & Engineering](https://databox.com/product-and-engineering)\n*   [Inside Databox](https://databox.com/category/inside-databox)\n*   [Become a Solutions Partner](https://databox.com/solutions-partner)\n*   [Terms of Service](https://databox.com/terms-of-service)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://databox.com/privacy-policy)\n*   [Talent Resources](https://databox.com/talent-resource-center)\n*   [We're Hiring!](https://databox.com/careers#jobs)\n\n**Support**\n\n*   [Start Chat](https://databox.com/pricing#)\n*   [Help Center](https://help.databox.com/)\n*   [Training](https://databox.com/business-analytics-course)\n*   [API Documentation](https://developers.databox.com/)\n*   [Status](https://status.databox.com/)\n\n [![Image 16: Download Databox App on the Google Play Store](https://cdn1.databox.com/website/images/google-play.svg)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.databox)[![Image 17: Download Databox App on the App Store](https://cdn1.databox.com/website/images/app-store.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/databox-business-analytics/id940584421)\n\nEasy-to-use analytics for growing businesses\n\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/2394209 \"Linkedin Databox page\")[](https://twitter.com/databoxHQ \"Twitter Databox page\")[](https://www.instagram.com/databoxhq \"Instagram Databox page\")[](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Databox-EI_IE1938956.11,18.htm \"Glassdoor Databox page\")\n\n![Image 18: Top Inspiring workplaces 2024 winner](https://cdnwebsite.databox.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/11020257/2024-inspiring-workplace-25-winner-612x1024-1.png)\n\n [![Image 19: Pledge 1%](https://cdn1.databox.com/website/images/pledge-one-percent.png)](https://pledge1percent.org/)\n\n2025 \u00a9 Databox, Inc.
