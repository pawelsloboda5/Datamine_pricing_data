If you are running a \"20% off\" evergreen offer for your course, that would be one campaign. Or if you're running a live launch with a specific fixed-date deadline, that would be another campaign.\n\nHow do you count leads?\n\n![Image 35](https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/close-faq.svg) ![Image 36](https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/open-faq.svg)\n\nWhen one of your subscribers enters a Deadline Funnel campaign, they are considered a lead. If the same subscriber enters multiple campaigns, they are counted as a lead in each campaign. So one subscriber who entered 5 of your Deadline Funnel campaigns is counted as 5 leads.\n\nWhich plan should I choose?\n\n![Image 37](https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/close-faq.svg) ![Image 38](https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/open-faq.svg)\n\nWe recommend our Create plan, which unlocks the full functionality of Deadline Funnel and is the most popular of all our plans. It's perfect for creators and business owners who want to create multiple deadlines and expect to bring in over 1,000 leads per month across all their campaigns.\n\nWhat does \"Data History\" mean?\n\n![Image 39](https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/close-faq.svg) ![Image 40](https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/open-faq.svg)\n\nOn the Start plan, you can see reports for how many people are going through your campaigns for the last 90 days. On the Create and Scale plans, you can view reports going back 6 months. This is just a reporting limit and doesn't affect anything else.\n\nWhat's the setup process like?\n\n![Image 41](https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/close-faq.svg) ![Image 42](https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/open-faq.svg)\n\nThanks to our onboarding sequences and helpful blueprints, setting up your Deadline Funnel campaign is both easy and quick.
