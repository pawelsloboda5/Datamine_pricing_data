We\u2019ve got answers\n--------------------------------\n\nHow long does a Beacon free trial last?\n\nA Beacon free trial lasts 14 days. [Sign up for your free account.](https://www.beacon.com/sign-up)\n\nHow do I buy more shipment tracking credits?\n\nWhen subscribing to Beacon, we'll ask for an estimate of your shipment volumes to determine the appropriate number of credits. If you use them up before your subscription renews, you can raise a request to add credits from your account settings. All credits are valid for two years from the date purchased.\n\nWhat are Live Boards?\n\nLive Boards are shared workspaces designed to simplify information sharing and communication across your supply chain. To create a Live Board, you specify your filter criteria to create a bespoke view of orders or shipments. The Live Board is then saved and shared with stakeholders. Chat and commenting capabilities allow you to centralize communication directly alongside the latest tracking updates \u2014 eliminating the need for long email chains and manually updated spreadsheets.\n\nWhat is the subscription term?\n\nBeacon subscriptions are for a minimum term of one year. You can choose to pay in monthly instalments or annually. Customers paying annually receive a 10% discount.\n\nImprove your supply chain visibility today\n------------------------------------------\n\nJoin leading businesses using Beacon to bring order to
