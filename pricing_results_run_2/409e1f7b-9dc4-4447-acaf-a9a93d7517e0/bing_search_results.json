questions\n--------------------------\n\n### How much does Chargebee Retention cost?\n\n### Chargebee Retention is a revenue-generating service, in that we save customers from canceling, and in doing so generate positive ROI. We charge based on your plan (Performance, or Enterprise) and your plan tier, depending on your volumes (or the number of monthly sessions). Your plan tier includes a number of base sessions per month (e.g. the 1000 - 2500 session Performance plan tier includes 1000 sessions per month), as well as a base session rate in case you exceed your session limit.\n\n### What is a session?\n\n### A session is when any user clicks \u201ccancel\u201d and is routed to a cancel deflection page. If an end-user revisits the cancel page within the save interval (watch list period), then they are deduplicated.\n\n### What happens if I exceed the number of base sessions included in my plan tier?\n\n### Don\u2019t worry. If you exceed the base session limit included in your plan (for example, you use 1,256 sessions on a 1,000 - 2,500 session Performance plan), you\u2019ll be charged at your plan\u2019s base session rate (e.g., the additional 256 sessions @ USD 0.90/session), up to the maximum number of sessions allowed by your plan (e.g., 2,500 in this case).\n\n### How can I make changes to my plan(upgrade, downgrade)?\n\n### Upgrade:\n\nYou can upgrade your plan at any time by contacting your Chargebee Retention representative or you will be prompted to do so if you exceed the number of maximum monthly sessions within your plan.\n\n* * *\n\nDowngrade:\n\nYou can request to do so at any time; however, the downgrade will not take effect until your contract is up for renewal (e.g., upon your annual renewal for the Performance or Enterprise plan).\n\nShow More\n\n[### 44% average cancellations deflected](https://www.chargebee.com/customers/pret/ \"Learn More\")\n\n[### 20% churn reduction within 30 days of implementation](https://www.chargebee.com/customers/pliability/ \"Learn More\")\n\n[### 2x increase in save rates](https://www.chargebee.com/customers/vital-proteins/ \"Learn More\")\n\nTo us, changing our cart was the equivalent of one of the Apollo missions where if the rocket blows up, we're all dead. **So that was how seriously we took (migration to a new tool).
