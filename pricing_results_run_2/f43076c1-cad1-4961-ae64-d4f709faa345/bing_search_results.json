Chats with contacts are opportunities to increase revenue and Monthly Active Contact pricing ensures you only pay for the contacts you talk to.\n\n![Image 6](https://assets1-proxy.respond.io/api/v1/image/assets%2F11f7a662b80a4675973850b067c01fa5%2F99ee64c688a842efb6176dfd8b9f15c9)\n\nWhy does Monthly Active Contact pricing start with the Growth plan?\n\nThe Starter plan is designed for users who typically handle chats themselves.  \nMeanwhile, the Growth plan introduces chat automation and AI so the same number of users can handle more conversations and close more deals. These high conversation volumes make Monthly Active Contacts relevant only for the Growth Plan and above.\n\n### starter\n\n$\n\n79/month\n\n$1,188 $948/yr (billed yearly)\n\nBig wins for small teams: Manage conversations across all channels collaboratively and achieve your business goals.\n\n[](https://app.respond.io/user/register)\n\nMost Popular\n\n### growth\n\n$\n\n159/month\n\n$2,388 $1,908/yr (billed yearly)\n\nFor growth-oriented teams: Track marketing campaign engagement and maximize conversions with automation and AI.\n\n[](https://app.respond.io/user/register)\n\n### advanced\n\n$\n\n279/month\n\n$4,188 $3,348/yr (billed yearly)\n\nFor tech-savvy teams: Scale with advanced integrations, multiple workspaces and enhanced security.\n\n[](https://respond.io/demo)\n\n### enterprise\n\nCustom\n\nTailored solutions for large teams: Double down on what works with unlimited users, more workspaces and higher API rate limits.\n\n[](https://respond.io/demo)\n\n\u2699\ufe0f Usage\n\nUsers\n\n5\n\nAdditional Users at $12/month\n\n10\n\nAdditional Users at $20/month\n\n10\n\nAdditional Users at $24/month\n\n\u267e\ufe0f Unlimited\n\nMonthly Active Contacts\n\n\u267e\ufe0f Unlimited\n\nStarts at 1,000\n\nStarts at 1,000\n\nCustom\n\n##### \ud83d\udcac Inbox & Contacts\n\nTeam & Custom Inboxes\n\nMobile App\n\nAI Prompts & AI Assist\n\n##### \ud83d\udce2 Broadcasts\n\nBroadcast\n\nBroadcast Analytics\n\n##### \u2728 Workflows & Automation\n\nWorkflow\n\nAI Agent\n\n##### \ud83d\udcbb Integrations\n\nHubspot\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nSalesforce\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nMeta & TikTok Ads\n\nMeta Product Catalog\n\nGrowth Widgets\n\nDeveloper API\n\nZapier & Make\n\nWebhook Events\n\nHTTP Requests Step\n\n##### \u260e\ufe0f Support\n\n24-Hour Chat Support\n\nOnboarding Program\n\nAdd-on\n\nAdd-on\n\nAdd-on\n\nAdd-on\n\n##### \ud83d\udcc8 Reports\n\nReal Time Dashboard\n\nBasic Reports\n\nAdvanced Reports\n\n##### \ud83d\udd12 Security\n\nData Export\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA)\n\nMask Phone Number & Email address\n\nSingle Sign-On (SSO)\n\n##### \ud83c\udfe2 Workspaces & Users\n\nMultiple Workspaces\n\nCustom\n\n##### \ud83d\udcde Voice\n\nWhatsApp Business Calling API\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nMessenger Calls\n\nComing soon\n\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\n\nComing soon\n\n##### \ud83d\udcac Chat\n\nChannels\n\nWhatsApp Business Platform (API): From $0.006 per conversation, varies by country.

Chats with contacts are opportunities to increase revenue and Monthly Active Contact pricing ensures you only pay for the contacts you talk to.\n\n![Image 6](https://assets1-proxy.respond.io/api/v1/image/assets%2F11f7a662b80a4675973850b067c01fa5%2F99ee64c688a842efb6176dfd8b9f15c9)\n\nWhy does Monthly Active Contact pricing start with the Growth plan?\n\nThe Starter plan is designed for users who typically handle chats themselves.  \nMeanwhile, the Growth plan introduces chat automation and AI so the same number of users can handle more conversations and close more deals. These high conversation volumes make Monthly Active Contacts relevant only for the Growth Plan and above.\n\n### starter\n\n$\n\n79/month\n\n$1,188 $948/yr (billed yearly)\n\nBig wins for small teams: Manage conversations across all channels collaboratively and achieve your business goals.\n\n[](https://app.respond.io/user/register)\n\nMost Popular\n\n### growth\n\n$\n\n159/month\n\n$2,388 $1,908/yr (billed yearly)\n\nFor growth-oriented teams: Track marketing campaign engagement and maximize conversions with automation and AI.\n\n[](https://app.respond.io/user/register)\n\n### advanced\n\n$\n\n279/month\n\n$4,188 $3,348/yr (billed yearly)\n\nFor tech-savvy teams: Scale with advanced integrations, multiple workspaces and enhanced security.\n\n[](https://respond.io/demo)\n\n### enterprise\n\nCustom\n\nTailored solutions for large teams: Double down on what works with unlimited users, more workspaces and higher API rate limits.\n\n[](https://respond.io/demo)\n\n\u2699\ufe0f Usage\n\nUsers\n\n5\n\nAdditional Users at $12/month\n\n10\n\nAdditional Users at $20/month\n\n10\n\nAdditional Users at $24/month\n\n\u267e\ufe0f Unlimited\n\nMonthly Active Contacts\n\n\u267e\ufe0f Unlimited\n\nStarts at 1,000\n\nStarts at 1,000\n\nCustom\n\n##### \ud83d\udcac Inbox & Contacts\n\nTeam & Custom Inboxes\n\nMobile App\n\nAI Prompts & AI Assist\n\n##### \ud83d\udce2 Broadcasts\n\nBroadcast\n\nBroadcast Analytics\n\n##### \u2728 Workflows & Automation\n\nWorkflow\n\nAI Agent\n\n##### \ud83d\udcbb Integrations\n\nHubspot\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nSalesforce\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nMeta & TikTok Ads\n\nMeta Product Catalog\n\nGrowth Widgets\n\nDeveloper API\n\nZapier & Make\n\nWebhook Events\n\nHTTP Requests Step\n\n##### \u260e\ufe0f Support\n\n24-Hour Chat Support\n\nOnboarding Program\n\nAdd-on\n\nAdd-on\n\nAdd-on\n\nAdd-on\n\n##### \ud83d\udcc8 Reports\n\nReal Time Dashboard\n\nBasic Reports\n\nAdvanced Reports\n\n##### \ud83d\udd12 Security\n\nData Export\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA)\n\nMask Phone Number & Email address\n\nSingle Sign-On (SSO)\n\n##### \ud83c\udfe2 Workspaces & Users\n\nMultiple Workspaces\n\nCustom\n\n##### \ud83d\udcde Voice\n\nWhatsApp Business Calling API\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nIncluded during beta\n\nMessenger Calls\n\nComing soon\n\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\n\nComing soon\n\n##### \ud83d\udcac Chat\n\nChannels\n\nWhatsApp Business Platform (API): From $0.006 per conversation, varies by country.
