there upfront costs or additional fees?\n\nSalesforce has all kinds of add-ons, apps, and additional products to help your company stay ahead in your industry. Call us at 1-800-664-9073 to discuss exactly what kind of products you\u2019re looking to add and how we can help.\n\n### What if my business priorities and product needs have changed?\n\nWe know things don\u2019t always go according to plan, and we\u2019re here and will try our best to support. Reach out to a sales representative at 1-800-664-9073 to discuss options.\n\n### Do Salesforce products integrate with outside applications and systems?\n\nIn many cases, Salesforce products integrate directly with many outside applications and systems to help you connect your data. For those that don\u2019t have built-in integration, like on-premises data sources, you can purchase licenses of MuleSoft, work with our integration partners, or use apps on AppExchange.\n\nTalk to a sales representative to get an idea of what integration solution works best with the Salesforce products you use.\n\n### What support and service packages are available?\n\nWe offer several advisory, adoption, and support plans to our customers. To learn more, visit [Success Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/services/overview/).\n\n### Can I pay monthly?\n\nYou can purchase licenses of Salesforce Starter with a monthly or annual contract. To get started, sign up and purchase Salesforce Starter directly from a free trial. All other subscriptions are generally paid annually in advance.\n\n### How long are your contracts?\n\nMost Salesforce products use annual contracts, but Salesforce subscription terms vary. Chat with a sales representative to discuss payment and billing options for your products.\n\n### Can I upgrade at any time? Can I add more products later on?\n\nYou can add products or upgrade at any time, but some products may need to scale together. Reach out to our sales department at 1-800-664-9073 to see what works for your business.\n\n### How does the free trial work?\n\nSimply fill out the free trial form, and your free trial will open inside the same window. From there, you can import data in minutes and take a look at everything we can do for your business. Trial subscriptions cannot be used in a production capacity and must be used only for non-production purposes.\n\nWhenever you\u2019re ready to buy, hit \u201cBuy Now\u201d from within your trial to purchase licenses. When your trial expires, you will be prompted to buy or give us a call for more info.\n\n### Will my data be private and safe?\n\nOur entire business is built on trust and security; over 150,000 businesses trust Salesforce to keep their data safe in the cloud. We work everyday to make our platform safer, more secure, and more transparent.\n\nVisit our [trust.salesforce.com](http://trust.salesforce.com/) to get a real-time view of platform performance and security, as well as our compliance certifications and security documentation.\n\nThis page is provided for information purposes only and subject to change.
