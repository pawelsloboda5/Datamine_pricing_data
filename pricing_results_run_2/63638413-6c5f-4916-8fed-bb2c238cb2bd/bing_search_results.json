businesses\n---------------------------------------\n\n### Heres what a few of them have to say about Phone.com\n\nEL\n\nEric L.\n\nJanuary 16, 2014\n\nI've been a VoIP customer for the last 10 years and can't image using anything else. I've used 8x8 and Ooma in the past, but 8x8 is expensive and Ooma isn't really business VoiP. Phone.com was the best choice for my latest company. They have great prices, excellent support and all the features that I need for my business.\n\nCM\n\nCarolyn M.\n\nAugust 13, 2019\n\nWe run a global company and Phone.come has provided all of our VOIP service needs for over a decade. Their custom service and technology teams are responsive and easy to work with. I highly recommend it!\n\nCC\n\nCarlos C.\n\nDecember 22, 2020\n\nAmazing price, features and Customer Support!\n\nRK\n\nRick K.\n\nJune 13, 2022\n\nPhone.com is the best VOIP Office phone service\n\nTL\n\nTiffany L.\n\nJanuary 25, 2017\n\nPhone.com is a great tool for a small business. I was able to buy an awesome 800 number from them and have it forwarded to my office phone. I can also set up call schedules, different levels of forwarding, and voicemail- text. Great software and highly recommended. Fair rates too.\n\nDG\n\nDeirdre G.\n\nJanuary 4, 2019\n\nLoved that this software allowed us to make and receive calls as well as set up conference calls with customers.\n\nCH\n\nCraig H.\n\nJanuary 22, 2020\n\nGreat virtual phone system for small price\n\nVR\n\nVictor R.\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nWork Calls Made Easy\n\nKM\n\nKimberly M.\n\nAugust 10, 2021\n\nEasy to use and Many Options\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\nAre there different business phone system prices?\n\nYes. Phone.com gives you multiple options to fit your precise business needs, so you only pay for what you need, when you need it. We also offer [add-on premium features](https://www.phone.com/premium-features/) for more advanced phone services. Business phone system pricing plans start at just $18 per month per user for the Basic plan. Want to save even more? Choose to be billed annually instead of monthly and save 17%.\n\nWhat is the definition of a \u201cUser?\u201d\n\nA user is anyone who can make or receive business calls using Phone.com. In most organizations, each employee who makes or receives calls will be a user. Good news! Adding more users might reduce your per-user rate.\n\nHow many users do I need?\n\nPhone.com allows you to pick the right plan for each user, so you pay for only what you need. For example, if you are the business owner, you might want to be a Pro user to take advantage of features like call recording and video meeting transcription. However, the basic user option might be sufficient for people who work in the field and take fewer calls.\n\nIs there a discount for multiple users?\n\nVolume discounts are available, [contact sales](https://www.phone.com/contact-sales/) for more information.\n\nCan I change my plan or add users after I sign up?\n\nYes. Once you have set up your account, you can add, change, or remove users.\n\nWhat are \u201cpooled\u201d minutes?\n\nEach basic user in your account will add 500 minutes to be used by any basic user in your account for inbound or outbound calling. For example, if you have 3 basic users in your account, 1,500 minutes will be available for use by any of those users. This applies only to basic users. All plus and pro users will have unlimited minutes.\n\nWhat happens if I exceed the minute or text segment limits on my plan?\n\nBasic users who use more than 500 minutes of inbound or outbound calling in one month will be charged $0.039 per minute for each additional minute.\n\nWhat taxes and fees are added to my bill?\n\nLike others in the industry, Phone.com must bill customers under the laws and regulations set in place by tax authorities and regulatory agencies, including federal, state, and local regulators. These jurisdictions and agencies assess taxes, fees, and surcharges for telecommunications-related services and programs that solution providers, including Phone.com, are obligated to collect from customers and remit to these agencies. There are also some surcharges that telephone-related services providers are permitted, but not required to pass through to customers.\n\nTaxes and fees that impact the telecommunications industry are frequently adjusted, based on your location, and subject to change without notice. If new or different taxes, surcharges, or fees are imposed on Phone.com, we will include those adjustments in applicable billings.\n\nDetailed information is available on the [Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website](https://www.fcc.gov/).\n\nAm I signing up for a contract?\n\nYou have a choice in pricing options with Phone.com. Depending on your business needs, you can choose between our month-to-month or annual payment options. Save by paying annually, or reserve the flexibility to cancel at any time by selecting month-to-month payments.\n\nWhat is included with Business Text Messages (SMS)?\n\nPhone.com\u2019s solution allows you to send and receive text and image messages using your business phone number. The US wireless carriers have implemented registration requirements, limitations and fees for outbound text messages to their customers. Customers that wish to use Phone.com for text messaging will need to register and accept these additional fees.\u00a0 [Learn more](https://support.phone.com/what-are-the-outbound-text-messaging-limitations-and-registration-requirements).\u00a0 Phone.com\u2019s service is intended for conversational text messaging.\u00a0 Bulk or high volume SMS is available at an additional cost.\n\nImportant Details and Disclaimers\n---------------------------------\n\n1.  Applicable federal and state taxes and fees will be added to your monthly invoice.Pooled and unlimited plans include calls to the United States and many area codes in Canada. Click here for\u00a0international rates.\n    \n2.  The 30-day money-back guarantee applies to user fees only. Premium phone numbers and hardware are excluded.\n3.  The US wireless carriers have implemented registration requirements and fees for outbound text messages to their customers. Customers that wish to use Phone.com for text messaging will need to register and accept these additional fees. Learn more.\n\n4.  All plans are subject to fair use restrictions on voice, text, and video. For more information refer to the Terms of Service. Business SMS is limited to Person-to-Person SMS, only.
