[Get in touch](mailto:hello@sharetribe.com), we are always happy to help!\n\nPricing FAQ\n-----------\n\n+\n\n### What is a transaction?\n\nA **transaction** in Sharetribe is defined as _an attempt at a value exchange between a customer and a provider_. Examples of transactions include placing an order, making a calendar booking, or initiating a conversation thread. A conversation thread between a buyer and a seller about a single listing only counts as one single transaction, even if there are several messages back and forth in that same thread.\n\n+\n\n### What is an environment?\n\nSharetribe accounts can have three types of environments: **Test**, **Dev**, and **Live**. Each environment has a unique set of users, listings, and transactions.\n\n*   When you create a Sharetribe account, it has a **Test environment** by default. This environment is for building your marketplace without coding.\u00a0\n*   If you want to customize your marketplace with code, you need to enable a **Dev environment**. That's where custom development happens.\n*   The **Live environment** has your actual users, listings, and transactions. In the Test and Dev environments, you can test work-in-progress changes with test data and copy them to your Live environment when you\u2019re done.\u00a0\n\nThe Build plan includes one Test and one Dev environment. You only need a Live environment when you're ready to onboard real users. To enable a Live environment, you need to subscribe to a live plan (Lite, Pro, or Extend).\n\nIf you have a complex custom development workflow, you may need more than one development environment. Additional Dev environments are available at $49/month.\n\n+\n\n### Will you be there to help?\n\nYes, definitely! If you can't find the answer in our [Help Center](https://www.sharetribe.com/help/en/), then email support is available seven days a week in all our plans, including during the free 14-day trial. Send us a message, and we\u2019ll get back to you in no time.\n\n+\n\n### How does the free 14-day trial work?\n\nYou can start your free trial without any credit card details and build your platform as you want it. You'll have all Build plan features at your disposal for free for the duration of the trial. At the end of the trial, you will be prompted to subscribe to the Build plan at $39/month to continue building your marketplace. You can also subscribe to the Lite, Pro, or Extend plan at any time during your trial when you're ready to invite in actual users.\n\n+\n\n### Do I need to know how to code to build my marketplace?\n\nNo. You can build the marketplace yourself; no coding skills required. You can build a fully functional marketplace without touching a single line of code. If you need unique features that are not available in Sharetribe out of the box, you can [hire a Sharetribe Expert](https://www.sharetribe.com/experts/) or another developer to add them for you. If you hire a developer, they will charge you based on their individual rates. If you have coding skills, you can also add new features and design yourself (this requires HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills).\n\n+\n\n### Do I need to pay for hosting?\n\nNo. You don't need to install or host anything. Sharetribe's [hosted cloud infrastructure](https://www.sharetribe.com/features/hosted-cloud-infrastructure/) takes care of that for you. Hosting is included in all our pricing plans. If you want to use your own domain, you need to purchase the domain and connect it to your Sharetribe-hosted marketplace. Otherwise, your marketplace will hosted at \\[your-marketplace\\].mysharetribe.com. However, if you end up using the developer platform to add custom features, you need to install and host the custom code you've written yourself. This is still easy and affordable, as you only need to host the frontend code. The heavy lifting related to databases and business logic happens on Sharetribe's servers. Your custom code connects to Sharetribe's servers via APIs.\n\n+\n\n### What does \u201cyour own domain\u201d mean?\n\nThe default URL address of your marketplace is **yourmarketplace.mysharetribe.com**. However, you can use your own domain (e.g., www.example.com) instead. This feature is available from the Pro plan.\n\n+\n\n### What does \u201cyour own outgoing email address\u201d mean?\n\nUnless you connect an outgoing email address, messages from your marketplace are sent from noreply+yourmarketplace@mysharetribe.com. You can use your own email address (e.g., info@example.com) from the Pro plan.\n\n+\n\n### Are there any additional costs in addition to the ones listed above?\n\nAll of Sharetribe's fees are outlined on this page. However, to enable certain functionality in your marketplace, you may need to connect with third-party services that have their own pricing.\n\n*   Payments: Sharetribe\u2019s default payment system is powered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/customers/sharetribe). If online payments are enabled on your marketplace, Stripe charges you a fee for each transaction according to their standard pricing. Typically, this is around 1.5-3% of the transaction size. [Learn more about Stripe\u2019s fees](https://stripe.com/connect).\n*   Maps: If you use map features, you can choose between Google Maps and Mapbox as your map provider. Both offer limited access for free, but if you have lots of traffic, they charge you for it.\n*   Analytics: Google Analytics is a free analytics option in Sharetribe. For cookie-free analytics, Sharetribe has an integration with [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), whose plans start at $9/month.\n*   Third-party tools: If you connect third-party services with Zapier or other [pre-built integrations](https://www.sharetribe.com/features/pre-built-integrations/), you need to pay the fees these companies charge.\n*   Frontend hosting: If you use the developer platform to add custom features, you need to install and host your custom code on your own server. We recommend [Render](https://render.com/) for hosting. Their $19/month plan takes you pretty far.\n*   Custom development: If you hire a developer to build custom features, you need to pay the developer according to their rate.\n\n+\n\n### Do you offer volume discounts if I have a lot of transactions?\n\nYes! If you have a large volume of transactions, we offer you a lower cost per transaction. [Learn more about Sharetribe's volume pricing.](https://www.sharetribe.com/pricing/#pricing-info)\n\n+\n\n### Do you offer a discount for non-profits?\n\nAbsolutely. We offer a special 25% discount to registered non-profits and [steward-owned companies](https://www.sharetribe.com/balanced/steward-ownership-is-capitalism-2-0/) on all plans. Contact us for more information at [hello@sharetribe.com](mailto:hello@sharetribe.com).\n\n+\n\n### If I upgrade to a higher plan in the middle of a subscription period, will I lose the money I paid for the earlier plan?\n\nNo. The remainder of your last subscription payment will be credited towards your new plan.\n\n+\n\n### Can I pause my subscription?\n\nYes! You can pause your subscription by downgrading to the Hold plan at $49/month. When your marketplace is on hold, your users can\u2019t log in or take actions in your marketplace, but your data will be kept intact. You can reactivate your marketplace anytime by subscribing to one of our regular plans.\n\n+\n\n### What happens if I want to leave Sharetribe?\n\nYou own your data. You can request a full marketplace data export. In addition, you can continue using the code of Sharetribe Web Template, which is open source, and any customizations you have made to it. However, if you want to make your Sharetribe Web Template powered marketplace work without Sharetribe\u2019s hosted cloud infrastructure, you have to replace Sharetribe\u2019s proprietary backend and APIs with your own.\n\n+\n\n### Can I get a refund of my subscription payment?\n\nSharetribe does not provide refunds by default. You can cancel your subscription at any time before your next renewal date. If you cancel after the renewal date, your subscription will remain active until the next renewal. However, we understand that life happens, and some extraordinary circumstances may warrant a refund. If you feel your case deserves re-assessment, [please contact us](mailto:hello@sharetribe.com). We're happy to review and discuss your case.\n\nStart your 14-day free trial\n\nCreate a marketplace today!\n---------------------------\n\n*   Launch quickly, without coding\n*   Extend infinitely\n*

[Get in touch](mailto:hello@sharetribe.com), we are always happy to help!\n\nPricing FAQ\n-----------\n\n+\n\n### What is a transaction?\n\nA **transaction** in Sharetribe is defined as _an attempt at a value exchange between a customer and a provider_. Examples of transactions include placing an order, making a calendar booking, or initiating a conversation thread. A conversation thread between a buyer and a seller about a single listing only counts as one single transaction, even if there are several messages back and forth in that same thread.\n\n+\n\n### What is an environment?\n\nSharetribe accounts can have three types of environments: **Test**, **Dev**, and **Live**. Each environment has a unique set of users, listings, and transactions.\n\n*   When you create a Sharetribe account, it has a **Test environment** by default. This environment is for building your marketplace without coding.\u00a0\n*   If you want to customize your marketplace with code, you need to enable a **Dev environment**. That's where custom development happens.\n*   The **Live environment** has your actual users, listings, and transactions. In the Test and Dev environments, you can test work-in-progress changes with test data and copy them to your Live environment when you\u2019re done.\u00a0\n\nThe Build plan includes one Test and one Dev environment. You only need a Live environment when you're ready to onboard real users. To enable a Live environment, you need to subscribe to a live plan (Lite, Pro, or Extend).\n\nIf you have a complex custom development workflow, you may need more than one development environment. Additional Dev environments are available at $49/month.\n\n+\n\n### Will you be there to help?\n\nYes, definitely! If you can't find the answer in our [Help Center](https://www.sharetribe.com/help/en/), then email support is available seven days a week in all our plans, including during the free 14-day trial. Send us a message, and we\u2019ll get back to you in no time.\n\n+\n\n### How does the free 14-day trial work?\n\nYou can start your free trial without any credit card details and build your platform as you want it. You'll have all Build plan features at your disposal for free for the duration of the trial. At the end of the trial, you will be prompted to subscribe to the Build plan at $39/month to continue building your marketplace. You can also subscribe to the Lite, Pro, or Extend plan at any time during your trial when you're ready to invite in actual users.\n\n+\n\n### Do I need to know how to code to build my marketplace?\n\nNo. You can build the marketplace yourself; no coding skills required. You can build a fully functional marketplace without touching a single line of code. If you need unique features that are not available in Sharetribe out of the box, you can [hire a Sharetribe Expert](https://www.sharetribe.com/experts/) or another developer to add them for you. If you hire a developer, they will charge you based on their individual rates. If you have coding skills, you can also add new features and design yourself (this requires HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills).\n\n+\n\n### Do I need to pay for hosting?\n\nNo. You don't need to install or host anything. Sharetribe's [hosted cloud infrastructure](https://www.sharetribe.com/features/hosted-cloud-infrastructure/) takes care of that for you. Hosting is included in all our pricing plans. If you want to use your own domain, you need to purchase the domain and connect it to your Sharetribe-hosted marketplace. Otherwise, your marketplace will hosted at \\[your-marketplace\\].mysharetribe.com. However, if you end up using the developer platform to add custom features, you need to install and host the custom code you've written yourself. This is still easy and affordable, as you only need to host the frontend code. The heavy lifting related to databases and business logic happens on Sharetribe's servers. Your custom code connects to Sharetribe's servers via APIs.\n\n+\n\n### What does \u201cyour own domain\u201d mean?\n\nThe default URL address of your marketplace is **yourmarketplace.mysharetribe.com**. However, you can use your own domain (e.g., www.example.com) instead. This feature is available from the Pro plan.\n\n+\n\n### What does \u201cyour own outgoing email address\u201d mean?\n\nUnless you connect an outgoing email address, messages from your marketplace are sent from noreply+yourmarketplace@mysharetribe.com. You can use your own email address (e.g., info@example.com) from the Pro plan.\n\n+\n\n### Are there any additional costs in addition to the ones listed above?\n\nAll of Sharetribe's fees are outlined on this page. However, to enable certain functionality in your marketplace, you may need to connect with third-party services that have their own pricing.\n\n*   Payments: Sharetribe\u2019s default payment system is powered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/customers/sharetribe). If online payments are enabled on your marketplace, Stripe charges you a fee for each transaction according to their standard pricing. Typically, this is around 1.5-3% of the transaction size. [Learn more about Stripe\u2019s fees](https://stripe.com/connect).\n*   Maps: If you use map features, you can choose between Google Maps and Mapbox as your map provider. Both offer limited access for free, but if you have lots of traffic, they charge you for it.\n*   Analytics: Google Analytics is a free analytics option in Sharetribe. For cookie-free analytics, Sharetribe has an integration with [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), whose plans start at $9/month.\n*   Third-party tools: If you connect third-party services with Zapier or other [pre-built integrations](https://www.sharetribe.com/features/pre-built-integrations/), you need to pay the fees these companies charge.\n*   Frontend hosting: If you use the developer platform to add custom features, you need to install and host your custom code on your own server. We recommend [Render](https://render.com/) for hosting. Their $19/month plan takes you pretty far.\n*   Custom development: If you hire a developer to build custom features, you need to pay the developer according to their rate.\n\n+\n\n### Do you offer volume discounts if I have a lot of transactions?\n\nYes! If you have a large volume of transactions, we offer you a lower cost per transaction. [Learn more about Sharetribe's volume pricing.](https://www.sharetribe.com/pricing/#pricing-info)\n\n+\n\n### Do you offer a discount for non-profits?\n\nAbsolutely. We offer a special 25% discount to registered non-profits and [steward-owned companies](https://www.sharetribe.com/balanced/steward-ownership-is-capitalism-2-0/) on all plans. Contact us for more information at [hello@sharetribe.com](mailto:hello@sharetribe.com).\n\n+\n\n### If I upgrade to a higher plan in the middle of a subscription period, will I lose the money I paid for the earlier plan?\n\nNo. The remainder of your last subscription payment will be credited towards your new plan.\n\n+\n\n### Can I pause my subscription?\n\nYes! You can pause your subscription by downgrading to the Hold plan at $49/month. When your marketplace is on hold, your users can\u2019t log in or take actions in your marketplace, but your data will be kept intact. You can reactivate your marketplace anytime by subscribing to one of our regular plans.\n\n+\n\n### What happens if I want to leave Sharetribe?\n\nYou own your data. You can request a full marketplace data export. In addition, you can continue using the code of Sharetribe Web Template, which is open source, and any customizations you have made to it. However, if you want to make your Sharetribe Web Template powered marketplace work without Sharetribe\u2019s hosted cloud infrastructure, you have to replace Sharetribe\u2019s proprietary backend and APIs with your own.\n\n+\n\n### Can I get a refund of my subscription payment?\n\nSharetribe does not provide refunds by default. You can cancel your subscription at any time before your next renewal date. If you cancel after the renewal date, your subscription will remain active until the next renewal. However, we understand that life happens, and some extraordinary circumstances may warrant a refund. If you feel your case deserves re-assessment, [please contact us](mailto:hello@sharetribe.com). We're happy to review and discuss your case.\n\nStart your 14-day free trial\n\nCreate a marketplace today!\n---------------------------\n\n*   Launch quickly, without coding\n*   Extend infinitely\n*
