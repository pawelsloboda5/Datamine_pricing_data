Since the initial sample users do not count toward your licenses, you can also keep the sample users for testing.\n\n##### How does the minimum pricing work?\n\nThe minimum subscription pricing on our Elevate plan is equal to purchasing the tool for 50 users. This would be $5,400 on our annual plan.\n\n##### Do you offer discounts?\n\nA core part of our model is affordable pricing for everyone and our normal rate reflects that. We do offer a volume discount for accounts with 200 or more active users on our Elevate plan.\n\n##### Does Small Improvements provide training?\n\nBased on experience, people rarely struggle with the product itself. But if you need some pointers on how to educate your team on giving feedback, setting effective objectives, or conducting 1:1s, please get in touch. We\u2019re happy to help.\n\n##### Can anyone become a customer?\n\nWe value our customers greatly and strive to ensure their satisfaction. However, we have certain criteria that must be met for a business to become a client. We do not currently work with any armed forces and reserve the right to refuse entry to any business whose model or practices do not align with our ethical standards.\n\nWe carefully assess each case individually and provide quotes accordingly to avoid any surprises. Although it is rare, we may decline potential clients who do not meet our values. Reach out to our sales team early to understand if this applies to you.\n\nUnlock your company\u2019s full potential\n------------------------------------\n\n![Image 16](blob:http://localhost/9f67afbbfc378de8e273414c8d3922eb)",
