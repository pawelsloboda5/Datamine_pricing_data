Having a trained and personable voice has transformed our ability to answer the phone and convert callers to clients.\n\n[Read case study](https://smith.ai/case-studies/cmit-solutions-downtown-chicago)\n\n##### Frequently asked questions\n\nOur AI answering service costs a little bit more because it does a lot more. Unlike others offering AI that stops at answering basic questions (assuming they even get them right, which most don\u2019t), you can trust us with your business\u2019 reputation. First, we have humans in the loop. With our AI\u00a0Receptionist, your calls are always handled by our AI first, but if something complex comes up, the call can be transferred to a live North America-based receptionist \u2014 any time, day or night. This built-in human backup ensures your callers get the help they need while you never get interrupted. It's the perfect blend of efficiency and reliability. Second, our system is designed specifically to qualify your leads based on our industry-leading experience answering over 10 million calls for businesses in the past 10 years. So yes, it\u2019s a bit pricier than the competition \u2014 because we\u2019re committed to making every interaction exceptional.\n\nNo. Smith.ai does not charge for spam calls \u2014 as long as we can block them in the future. If you use a forwarding service but disable Caller ID pass-through (common with Google Voice clients), we won\u2019t be able to block them, and thus you will be charged for those calls. You can learn more about this [here](https://docs.smith.ai/article/t5ba81iu37-article-36-why-we-need-caller-id).\n\nWith technology! Our system automatically blocks over 20 million spam and robocalls from ever getting through. If a new spam number does get through, you can mark it as spam to add it to the spam list so it can\u2019t get through ever again.\n\nNo. AI\u00a0Receptionist is a month-to-month service. This means there aren\u2019t any long-term contracts. You pay for the AI\u00a0Receptionist service each month. If you ever cancel, we need 30 days' notice, and then you\u2019re done. And we will miss you.\n\nYes, at any time. We make it easy. If you would like to change your plan, just email [support@smith.ai](mailto:support@smith.ai). We'll start billing for your new plan the next month.\n\nBecause unlike per-minute services, our success is aligned with your success. Billing per call means there\u2019s no mystery accounting involved. You\u2019re trusting us to represent your business. We\u2019re optimized for the exact right length of calls, not more or less. Per-minute services work opposite to your needs; they want to maximize your call length while you want to minimize your call time.\n\nDo you want your business to succeed? Well, good. We do, too. A successful business can\u2019t afford to miss a single lead or sales opportunity. (By the time you call them back, they\u2019ve likely found someone else\u2026 or if they\u2019re really bad, they\u2019ll leave a negative review because you didn\u2019t answer.) Our AI\u00a0Receptionist isn\u2019t just another AI; it\u2019s the only one on the market designed specifically for lead qualification and with 24/7 human backup. If a caller needs more than what our AI can handle, they get immediately transferred to a real person to help. No missed calls, no frustrated customers \u2014 just flawless support. And here\u2019s the best part: It\u2019s a fraction of the cost of an in-house receptionist, yet it works 24/7 and never takes a lunch break. So, you\u2019re not just paying for an answering service; you\u2019re investing in a solution that\u2019s always on, always reliable, and always working for you.\n\nAt Smith.ai we want our services to provide real value for your business and truly take work off your plate. And we want you to be able to fully experience what it\u2019s like to have us on the front lines, risk free. That\u2019s why we offer a 14-day money-back guarantee to all new clients. We get it. Things happen. If you decide Smith.ai isn\u2019t for you in the first two weeks, we\u2019ll refund your initial plan \u2014 no strings attached.\n\nTo receive your money back, send us your request within 14 days of your subscription date. Please send it via email to [support@smith.ai](mailto:support@smith.ai) with the subject line \u201cMoney-Back Request.\u201d\n\nHere are the details:\n\n*   New clients of Smith.ai can get their money back on Starter, Basic, Pro, and Custom plans for 14 days.\n*   If you want to cancel your service for any reason in the first 14 days, you get a refund of your plan and any add-on services, regardless of how many calls or chats you have used, up to $1,000.\n*   Any calls over your plan quota (\u201coverage\u201d) are not included in the money-back guarantee.  \n    \n\nWe offer volume discounts and can create a custom plan to suit your high-volume needs. Please [book a free consultation](https://smith.ai/booking-air) with our team.\n\n### Take the faster path to growth.\n\nGet Smith.ai today.\n\nAffordable plans for every budget.\n\nAffordable pricing to enhance your sales & support teams \u2014 get superior 24/7 customer engagement services with live North America-based agents.",

If you decide Smith.ai isn\u2019t for you in the first two weeks, we\u2019ll refund your initial plan \u2014 no strings attached.\n\nYou sign up for a plan, we onboard you, generate a number, and start sending your calls to our receptionists. To receive your money back, simply send us an email within 14 days at [support@smith.ai](mailto:support@smith.ai). You\u2019ll get a full refund of your plan and any add-on services, regardless of how many calls or chats you have used, up to $1,000. Note: Any calls or chats over your plan quota (\u201coverage\u201d) are not included in the money-back guarantee.\n\nSmith is a month-to-month service. This means there aren\u2019t any long term contracts. You pay for the receptionist service each month. If you ever cancel, we bill for and through the end of the current monthly billing cycle, and then you\u2019re done. And we will miss you.\n\nYes, at any time. We make it easy. If you would like to change your plan, just email [support@smith.ai](mailto:support@smith.ai). We'll start billing for your new plan the next month.\n\nNo, as long as the lines you forward to us pass Caller ID, you won\u2019t be charged for spam or unsolicited sales calls.\n\nVersus by minute? Billing per client call saves you money, and there\u2019s no mystery accounting involved. You\u2019re trusting us to represent you. You wouldn\u2019t rush a client off the phone and we don\u2019t either.\n\nEven our most expensive plan, the pro plan, is about $33,000 less than the yearly salary of an in-house receptionist, and we still have capabilities they likely don\u2019t. But if you\u2019re not considering a receptionist, you might not have considered the real cost of all your daily interruptions. Give us a try and find out.\n\nNo problem. Just tell us what hours you want us to answer, and calls outside your set answering hours can go to a number you choose, or to voicemail. Or, if you're using something fancy like RingCentral, you can set up your forwarding to only forward during those hours. The great thing about per-call pricing is that it doesn't matter if we answer calls for you 24/7 or 2 hours a day\u2014 the pricing is the same.\n\nNope! Smith.ai is a great service as a virtual front desk for small businesses with multiple employees. For individual routing (such as real estate agents in a firm or IT consultants in the field), we offer up to two routing numbers in the Basic plan, ten in the Pro plan, and additional transfer destinations for $15/month.\n\nYes! We offer a 10% discount for subscribing for 12 months.\n\n### Take the faster path to growth.\n\nGet Smith.ai today.\n\nAffordable plans for every budget.\n\nAffordable pricing to enhance your sales & support teams \u2014 get superior 24/7 customer engagement services with live North America-based agents.",
