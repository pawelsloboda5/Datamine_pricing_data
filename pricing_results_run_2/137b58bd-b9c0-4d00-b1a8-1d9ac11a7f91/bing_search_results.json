For small businesses who need more branding and functionality, our Pro plan is available for $59 amount per month. Our Business plan costs $129 amount per month and offers an array of features to scale with your business. You will receive a discount if you purchase an annual plan.\n\nIf you have bespoke needs, please talk to us about our Enterprise plan.\n\n What happens if I go over my limits?\nWe will notify you if you are approaching your limits. You can upgrade your plan at any time to avoid any disruption to your service. Additionally, on the billing page you may also be able to purchase addons for your current plan to extend your limits.\n\nIf you have bespoke needs, please talk to us about our Enterprise plan.\n\n Is Paperform free?\nNo. We give you what no one else does for a competitive price. We work hard to add new features and functionality that expands the product, and costs us more than if we were providing a generic form builder. We have a 7 day free trial with full functionality to give you a solid opportunity to take Paperform for a spin.\n\n How do Scoring, Custom Pricing Rules, and Calculation Field features work?\nWe support a few different types of calculations. Scoring allows you to define rules that add up an overall score for your form. Custom Pricing Rules let you define conditions that will manipulate the final price of a product or service, and the Calculations Field lets you write a formula to determine what the result is based on other answers. Paperform is extremely powerful and dynamic!\n\n Can I take payments with Paperform?\nYes. Payments are available across all pricing tiers for you to sell your products or services. Our payments are powered by Stripe, Square, Braintree and PayPal Business. We also support Google Pay and a range of payment methods supported by these providers.\n\n Is Paperform secure?\nYes. Your data is securely stored via Amazon in the U.S.A, which is GDPR compliant. (Learn more about Paperform and GDPR here.) Form submissions are secured using TLS 1.2 SSL from the submitter\u2019s browser through to our servers, and forms and submissions are encrypted at rest. To learn more about security, including best practices, see here.\n\n Does Paperform offer a \u2018one question at a time\u2019 style layout?\nYes. Guided Mode provides a \u2018one question at a time\u2019 experience. This can be switched on in the Theme menu within the editor, and toggled off at any time.\n\n Does Paperform support multiple languages?\nYes. For form content we support any language, as long as it\u2019s available in your chosen font. We also allow you to customize the default UI. This means you can change any component of our internal app and buttons to your language of choice.\n\n Can I request a feature?\nSure thing. We\u2019re always open to hearing ways you think we can improve and evolve. To make a request, contact us. Please include an example or specific use case so we can understand exactly what you\u2019re after and whether others share your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re here to answer your questions\nAsk our customer support team about Paperform\u2019s plans and pricing tiers, as well as features and anything else you might be wondering. We\u2019ve got real and wonderfully nerdy humans ready to help in real-time.
