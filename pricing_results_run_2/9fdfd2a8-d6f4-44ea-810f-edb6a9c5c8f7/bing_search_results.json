faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")\n\nSurvey credits indicate the number of surveys you can send to your customers within one month. Every time you send an email survey, or every time a customer opens an in-app (web), link, or Intercom survey, a survey credit will be spent.\n\nSurvey credits will be also spent if you survey the same customer multiple times or if you send them reminder surveys.\n\n[What happens when I reach the survey limit? ![Image 672: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")\n\nIf you run out of survey credits, email and in-app (web) surveys will be queued and will resume when your survey credits quota will reset the next month. The link and Intercom surveys, on the other hand, will be unaccessible for your customers until your survey credits are replenished.\n\nYou can request a one-time survey credits add-on for an extra payment to ensure that your survey process will not stop.\n\n[Do survey credits reset every month? ![Image 673: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")In our default subscription model your survey credits are replenished every month. Custom subscriptions may include a total number of survey credits that will reset yearly.\n\n[Is my plan limited on responses? ![Image 674: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")Retently doesn't limit the number of responses you receive. However, you will be charged an additional $100 per month for every 100,000 survey responses/feedback records stored in your account. Retently's value comes from analyzing customer feedback trends, so keeping all responses is usually the best approach.\n\n[How many customers can I import? ![Image 675: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")Retently doesn't limit the number of customers you can import from CSV files, sync automatically via native integrations, or import using our API. However, it's important to note that you will be charged an additional $100 per month for every 100,000 survey responses/feedback records stored in your account. This typically translates to 1 million contacts in your account. Retently's value comes from analyzing customer feedback trends, so keeping all responses is usually the best approach.\n\n[Can I translate the survey? ![Image 676: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")Yes, you can edit and translate a survey's rating question, the open-ended question, the multiple-options question, the thank you message, and the Unsubscribe page.\n\n[Difference between B2B and Ecommerce plans ![Image 677: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")\n\nOur pricing plans are grouped into B2B and Ecommerce to provide tailored integrations and features for each customer segment. For example, B2B plans offer integrations like HubSpot and Pipedrive, while Ecommerce plans include Shopify and Gorgias. Additionally, certain features are specific to each category; for instance, B2B plans include Company-level CX scores and recurring survey campaigns, which are not available in Ecommerce plans.\n\nIf your current subscription doesn't fit your industry or business model, we will proactively switch you to an equivalent subscription in the other category to ensure that our product fully meets your business needs and you receive the appropriate assistance.\n\n[Can I ask multiple questions? ![Image 678: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")Yes, besides the main rating and open-ended questions, Retently allows adding additional rating, multiple-option and open-ended questions, to gain more insight into the customer feedback. The questions can be personalized based on the customer\u2019s response.\n\n[What is a survey campaign? ![Image 679: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")\n\nA survey campaign includes its own survey template, will target a particular segment of your audience, will deliver surveys on its own schedule or trigger, and will include its own set of notifications and autoresponders.\n\nSurvey campaigns are ideal if you want to survey customers in different languages, if you want to survey your audience on different products, or to measure your customers' experience at different stages in their lifecycle journey.\n\n[Can I use another rating scale? ![Image 680: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")Retently gives you the possibility to measure different customer experience metrics, and each of them has it's own survey template with a different rating scale: NPS (0 - 10), CSAT (1 - 5), CES (1 - 7), and 5-STAR (1 - 5).\n\n[Can I embed the survey template? ![Image 681: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")Apart from triggering in-app (web) surveys which will be displayed in your web application as a pop-up, you can easily distribute the link to your survey by email or via any platform you find most suitable for your audience and business goals, be it Intercom, MailChimp, HubSpot, social media, etc.\n\n[Can I export the data? ![Image 682: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")\n\nYou can export all your customer and survey data from the Dashboard, Feedback, Outbox and Audience pages, as well as via Zapier, webhooks, and API while your Retently subscription is active. Some native integrations such as Intercom, HubSpot, or Salesforce, will automatically export a customer's last rating and feedback and add it to their profile.\n\nOnce canceled, your data will be deleted within 30 days.\n\n[Can I pay per month instead of a yearly commitment? ![Image 683: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing# \"open\")\n\nYes, you can choose the monthly version of our plans, which means that you will be charged for the subscription on a monthly basis without a yearly commitment.\n\nExceptions are the yearly-only plans, such as Enterprise, that do not have a \"month-by-month\" payment option. Such plans will be labeled accordingly.\n\nThe most powerful Customer Experience teams are powered by Retently\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![Image 684: Taryn Stark](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/price/testimonials/taryn-stark.png) Product Design Manager, Chargify \u201cRetently is easy to use, cost-effective, and delivers the results we need.

are survey credits? ![Image 654: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")\n\nSurvey credits indicate the number of surveys you can send to your customers within one month. Every time you send an email survey, or every time a customer opens an in-app (web), link, or Intercom survey, a survey credit will be spent.\n\nSurvey credits will be also spent if you survey the same customer multiple times or if you send them reminder surveys.\n\n[What happens when I reach the survey limit? ![Image 655: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")\n\nIf you run out of survey credits, email and in-app (web) surveys will be queued and will resume when your survey credits quota will reset the next month. The link and Intercom surveys, on the other hand, will be unaccessible for your customers until your survey credits are replenished.\n\nYou can request a one-time survey credits add-on for an extra payment to ensure that your survey process will not stop.\n\n[Do survey credits reset every month? ![Image 656: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")In our default subscription model your survey credits are replenished every month. Custom subscriptions may include a total number of survey credits that will reset yearly.\n\n[Is my plan limited on responses? ![Image 657: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")Retently doesn't limit the number of responses you receive. However, you will be charged an additional $100 per month for every 100,000 survey responses/feedback records stored in your account. Retently's value comes from analyzing customer feedback trends, so keeping all responses is usually the best approach.\n\n[How many customers can I import? ![Image 658: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")Retently doesn't limit the number of customers you can import from CSV files, sync automatically via native integrations, or import using our API. However, it's important to note that you will be charged an additional $100 per month for every 100,000 survey responses/feedback records stored in your account. This typically translates to 1 million contacts in your account. Retently's value comes from analyzing customer feedback trends, so keeping all responses is usually the best approach.\n\n[Can I translate the survey? ![Image 659: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")Yes, you can edit and translate a survey's rating question, the open-ended question, the multiple-options question, the thank you message, and the Unsubscribe page.\n\n[Difference between B2B and Ecommerce plans ![Image 660: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")\n\nOur pricing plans are grouped into B2B and Ecommerce to provide tailored integrations and features for each customer segment. For example, B2B plans offer integrations like HubSpot and Pipedrive, while Ecommerce plans include Shopify and Gorgias. Additionally, certain features are specific to each category; for instance, B2B plans include Company-level CX scores and recurring survey campaigns, which are not available in Ecommerce plans.\n\nIf your current subscription doesn't fit your industry or business model, we will proactively switch you to an equivalent subscription in the other category to ensure that our product fully meets your business needs and you receive the appropriate assistance.\n\n[Can I ask multiple questions? ![Image 661: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")Yes, besides the main rating and open-ended questions, Retently allows adding additional rating, multiple-option and open-ended questions, to gain more insight into the customer feedback. The questions can be personalized based on the customer\u2019s response.\n\n[What is a survey campaign? ![Image 662: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")\n\nA survey campaign includes its own survey template, will target a particular segment of your audience, will deliver surveys on its own schedule or trigger, and will include its own set of notifications and autoresponders.\n\nSurvey campaigns are ideal if you want to survey customers in different languages, if you want to survey your audience on different products, or to measure your customers' experience at different stages in their lifecycle journey.\n\n[Can I use another rating scale? ![Image 663: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")Retently gives you the possibility to measure different customer experience metrics, and each of them has it's own survey template with a different rating scale: NPS (0 - 10), CSAT (1 - 5), CES (1 - 7), and 5-STAR (1 - 5).\n\n[Can I embed the survey template? ![Image 664: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")Apart from triggering in-app (web) surveys which will be displayed in your web application as a pop-up, you can easily distribute the link to your survey by email or via any platform you find most suitable for your audience and business goals, be it Intercom, MailChimp, HubSpot, social media, etc.\n\n[Can I export the data? ![Image 665: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")\n\nYou can export all your customer and survey data from the Dashboard, Feedback, Outbox and Audience pages, as well as via Zapier, webhooks, and API while your Retently subscription is active. Some native integrations such as Intercom, HubSpot, or Salesforce, will automatically export a customer's last rating and feedback and add it to their profile.\n\nOnce canceled, your data will be deleted within 30 days.\n\n[Can I pay per month instead of a yearly commitment? ![Image 666: open/close faq](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/open-faq.svg)](https://www.retently.com/pricing/# \"open\")\n\nYes, you can choose the monthly version of our plans, which means that you will be charged for the subscription on a monthly basis without a yearly commitment.\n\nExceptions are the yearly-only plans, such as Enterprise, that do not have a \"month-by-month\" payment option. Such plans will be labeled accordingly.\n\nStart your free 14-day trial\n----------------------------\n\n### Get started with the world\u2019s most trusted CX software, in days, not months.\n\n![Image 667: Try Retently 7 days for free](https://www.retently.com/wp-content/themes/rew-theme/images/rdesign/price/price-cta.png)\n\nSign-up for a free trial, send an NPS survey to your clients and start gathering, analyzing, and acting on the received feedback.",
