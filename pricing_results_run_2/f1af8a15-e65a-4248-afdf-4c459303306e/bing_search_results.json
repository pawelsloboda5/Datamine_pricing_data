Right here, right now.\n\n\n\n\n     What is the difference between a user seat and an email account?\n\nOne user seat basically equals one additional person who can log into your Growbots account and run the campaigns. You can specify whether you\u2019d like them to be an admin or a regular user. Each user seat comes along with one email account for free!\nAn email account is an email you can integrate with Growbots in Settings -> Integrations and use it to send your campaigns. You can purchase & add multiple email accounts under one user seat.\n\n     What are credits? How do they work? (bounces)\n\nCredits are the Growbots \u201ccurrency\u201d used to purchase new leads. You get charged one credit in the moment of scheduling or exporting a new prospect from our database. Credits can be translated to a monthly limit of new prospects contacted \u2013 if you have 500 credits, you can schedule 500 new prospects each month.\nNote that credits don\u2019t limit the number of messages sent to each prospect \u2013 once you spend your credits on a particular lead, you can contact them as many times as you\u2019d like. Moreover, should you ever be provided with an inaccurate / inactive email address, you\u2019ll receive a refund of this credit, so you\u2019re only paying for actual, valuable leads.\n\n     Do credits accumulate from month to month?\n\nCredits don\u2019t roll over from month to month \u2013 they are \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d. We noticed that in order to have success in outbound campaigns, it\u2019s crucial to keep consistency in contacting new leads. In other words, on your renewal date your credits count resets to the number specified in your subscription \u2013 if you had any credits left in the previous period, they will disappear.\n\n     Do you have a referral program?\n\nWe do! We\u2019re running a referral program and strongly encourage you to participate in it. \n\nThrough our ambassador program, you can offer your network 15% discount & earn 15% of their monthly subscription up to $2,000 per person.\n\nFind more details here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlans\n\n\nCompare Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n   Prospecting Features    Freemium    Basic Filters    Advanced Filters   Email Verification on Import               Explore Database of 180M+ Prospects   Partial               Email Addresses                  Phone Numbers                  Social Media Accounts                  Import Your Own Contacts                  Accounts Data Enrichment                  Custom Data Delivery   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on   Hiring Data and Intent   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on \n\n\n\n\n\n   Prospecting Filters    Freemium    Basic Filters    Advanced Filters   Industry                  Finances                  Location                  Position                  Company Size                  Seniority                  Department Headcount               Funding               Direct Dials               Web Technologies               Web Traffic               Has Mobile App             \n\n\n\n\n\n   Outreach Features    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Number Of Email Accounts   20   Unlimited   Unlimited   Number Of Sequences   3   Unlimited   Unlimited   Sequences Max Steps   5   Unlimited   Unlimited   Daily Limits Per One Inbox   up to 20 per email   up to 100 per email   up to 500 per email   Email Integration   All Providers   All Providers   All Providers   Timezone Detection                     Email Personalization                     Shared Inbox                     Custom Tracking Domain                     Campaign Per Prospect Safety Feature                     Spintax Formulas                     Statistics and Benchmarking                  Open, Click & Reply Tracking                  Reply From Growbots                  Built-In Reports                  Separate Sending Limits per Prospect                  Prospect Table Tabs with Predefined Filters                  Folder Management                  Out-Of-Office Rescheduling                  Holidays Blocks                  A/B Testing                  Custom Fields                  Custom Custom Fields                  Do-Not-Contact Lists                  Tasks (LinkedIn, Call, Custom)               Activity Timeline               Custom Reports   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on \n\n\n\n\n\n   Warmup & Deliverability    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Deliverability Dashboard                     Gradual Automatic Warmup                     Warmup Daily Limits                     Email Authentication (DMARC, SPF, DKIM)                     Auto Unsubscribe                  Deliverability Email Domain Tests                  Message Deliverability Tests                  Separate Sending Limits                \n\n\n\n\n\n   Outbound Intelligence    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Warm Replies Detection                     Instant Target Finder                     Similar Companies Recommender (coming soon)                  Email Templates Generator               A/B Tests Variants Generator               AI Prospecting (coming soon)                AI Email Personalizer (coming soon)               AI Responder (coming soon)              \n\n\n\n\n\n   Integrations    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Zapier Integration                  BCC Integration                  Salesforce Bi-Sync Integration               Hubspot Bi-Sync Integration             \n\n\n\n\n\n   Price    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Base   Free   Starting from $29   Starting from $39   Additional User   Unlimited   Unlimited   Unlimited   Additional Email Account   20 free   Unlimited   Unlimited   Credits (Per Propsect)   From $0.13   From $0.13   From $0.13 \n\n\n\n\n\nStart your outbound sales journey with us today\nStart selling like crazy or talk to our expert during a consultation.

In other words, on your renewal date your credits count resets to the number specified in your subscription \u2013 if you had any credits left in the previous period, they will disappear.\n\n     Do you have a referral program?\n\nWe do! We\u2019re running a referral program and strongly encourage you to participate in it. \n\nThrough our ambassador program, you can offer your network 15% discount & earn 15% of their monthly subscription up to $2,000 per person.\n\nFind more details here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlans\n\n\nCompare Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n   Prospecting Features    Freemium    Basic Filters    Advanced Filters   Email Verification on Import               Explore Database of 180M+ Prospects   Partial               Email Addresses                  Phone Numbers                  Social Media Accounts                  Import Your Own Contacts                  Accounts Data Enrichment                  Custom Data Delivery   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on   Hiring Data and Intent   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on \n\n\n\n\n\n   Prospecting Filters    Freemium    Basic Filters    Advanced Filters   Industry                  Finances                  Location                  Position                  Company Size                  Seniority                  Department Headcount               Funding               Direct Dials               Web Technologies               Web Traffic               Has Mobile App             \n\n\n\n\n\n   Outreach Features    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Number Of Email Accounts   20   Unlimited   Unlimited   Number Of Sequences   3   Unlimited   Unlimited   Sequences Max Steps   5   Unlimited   Unlimited   Daily Limits Per One Inbox   up to 20 per email   up to 100 per email   up to 500 per email   Email Integration   All Providers   All Providers   All Providers   Timezone Detection                     Email Personalization                     Shared Inbox                     Custom Tracking Domain                     Campaign Per Prospect Safety Feature                     Spintax Formulas                     Statistics and Benchmarking                  Open, Click & Reply Tracking                  Reply From Growbots                  Built-In Reports                  Separate Sending Limits per Prospect                  Prospect Table Tabs with Predefined Filters                  Folder Management                  Out-Of-Office Rescheduling                  Holidays Blocks                  A/B Testing                  Custom Fields                  Custom Custom Fields                  Do-Not-Contact Lists                  Tasks (LinkedIn, Call, Custom)               Activity Timeline               Custom Reports   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on   Paid Add-on \n\n\n\n\n\n   Warmup & Deliverability    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Deliverability Dashboard                     Gradual Automatic Warmup                     Warmup Daily Limits                     Email Authentication (DMARC, SPF, DKIM)                     Auto Unsubscribe                  Deliverability Email Domain Tests                  Message Deliverability Tests                  Separate Sending Limits                \n\n\n\n\n\n   Outbound Intelligence    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Warm Replies Detection                     Instant Target Finder                     Similar Companies Recommender (coming soon)                  Email Templates Generator               A/B Tests Variants Generator               AI Prospecting (coming soon)                AI Email Personalizer (coming soon)               AI Responder (coming soon)              \n\n\n\n\n\n   Integrations    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Zapier Integration                  BCC Integration                  Salesforce Bi-Sync Integration               Hubspot Bi-Sync Integration             \n\n\n\n\n\n   Price    Freemium    Starter Outreach    Pro Outreach   Base   Free   Starting from $29   Starting from $39   Additional User   Unlimited   Unlimited   Unlimited   Additional Email Account   20 free   Unlimited   Unlimited   Credits (Per Propsect)   From $0.13   From $0.13   From $0.13 \n\n\n\n\n\nStart your outbound sales journey with us today\nStart selling like crazy or talk to our expert during a consultation.
