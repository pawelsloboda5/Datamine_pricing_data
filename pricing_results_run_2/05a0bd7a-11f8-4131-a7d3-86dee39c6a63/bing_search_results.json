They taught our team how to build email and SMS automations from scratch. In the past, our employees were unsure how automations worked. Now, they have a clear understanding of what is possible and how to execute it.\u201d_\n\n[Read full Customer Story](https://sendlane.webflow.io/customer-stories/rx-smart-gear)\n\n![Image 3](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcfd42a1d06cd880266a30a/63d86e08dca70b0bf96bc780_quote.svg)\n\n![Image 4: Image Lifeboost coffee logo](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcfd42a1d06cd880266a30a/63dabe505d2c8a5efc74c8dc_Lifeboost%20Logo.webp)\n\n_\u201cAs soon as we switched to Sendlane, email deliverability went up by 39%, and revenue from email just keeps growing. One of the emails we sent generated $30k alone, other campaigns can easily bring in $10k-$15k each time, and our revenue per contact has increased to almost $83. Our goal is a million in revenue per month from email, and we\u2019re pushing close now.\u201d_\n\n![Image 5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcfd42a1d06cd880266a30a/63daa74ccdcb6b8ab932ac1b_Dr%20Charles%20Livingston.webp)\n\n**Dr. Charles Livingston  \n**\n\nCEO\n\n[Read full Customer Story](https://sendlane.webflow.io/customer-stories/lifeboost)\n\n![Image 6](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcfd42a1d06cd880266a30a/63d86e08dca70b0bf96bc780_quote.svg)\n\n![Image 7](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcfd42a1d06cd880266a30a/63d87612fb4657e2ce25c280_image%2063.webp)\n\n_\u201cWe needed something with robust eCommerce email features that could grow with us but also easy enough to use that so we weren\u2019t held back. Sendlane offered more flexibility with their Automations than MailChimp, and the customer service was the best by far. It was simple enough to build and send campaigns, but we can do so much more to help us grow.

And don't worry, all of our prices will be prorated.\n\nMay I bring over existing contacts?\n\nWe offer a variety of migration services to help you bring over your active contacts and automations!
