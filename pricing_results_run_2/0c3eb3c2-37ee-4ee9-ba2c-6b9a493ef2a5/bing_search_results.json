Every envelope is sent to the signers in an email containing an exclusive signing link that allows them to access, view, and digitally sign the documents. An account or a subscription is only required for those in your organization who will use Zoho Sign to self-sign business documents or send them out for signature.\n    \n*   ### How does the 14-day free trial work?\n    \n    Upon signing up, you get a 14-day free trial with access to the Enterprise plan by default. You are not required to enter your credit card details to avail this trial. You can switch freely between the different plans during the trial period to explore and understand their respective features and limitations. During this period, you can add a maximum of 10 users and get up to 50 documents signed. Documents signed during the free trial will carry a watermark.\n    \n*   ### What happens when the trial period ends?\n    \n    After the 14-day trial period, if you have not upgraded to a paid plan, you will be automatically moved to the Free plan, with all your data intact. You may then subscribe to our [general plans](javascript:;) / [API-only plan](https://www.zoho.com/sign/pricing-api.html) at any time.\n    \n*   ### How can I upgrade my account?\n    \n    The portal owner i.e. the organization administrator who is the payment owner is the only person who can upgrade your account. If you are the portal owner, log in to Zoho Sign, navigate to Settings \\>\\> Subscription details \\>\\> Upgrade and the wizard will guide you through the process.\n    \n*   ### Whom should I contact for sales-related questions?\n    \n    If you have questions on the pricing, please write to us at [sales@zohocorp.com](mailto:sales@zohocorp.com).\n    \n*   ### Can I upgrade/downgrade/cancel my account at anytime?\n    \n    Yes. Zoho Sign is a pay-as-you-go service so you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at anytime.\n    \n*   ### What is an envelope?\n    \n    An envelope is an individual digital signature workflow or request initiated in Zoho Sign, either manually from the app interface or using other options such as API, mobile SDKs, automations, custom functions, and integrations across both Zoho and third-party apps. Each envelope can contain multiple documents and can be sent to multiple recipients with different roles in a specified order. Whenever a digital signature workflow is executed or an envelope is sent for signature, we say that a signature request has been raised or generated. In bulk send and SignForms, a unique envelope is generated for every recipient in the uploaded CSV file and every response received respectively.\n    \n*   ### When should I purchase Zoho Sign credits?\n    \n    [Zoho Sign credits](https://www.zoho.com/sign/zoho-sign-credits.html) are a separate add-on you can purchase in denominations of 500 at US$0_.10_ per credit. You should purchase them if you plan to use the features that consume them. These credits are consumed to absorb the additional cost incurred by high volume automations or third-party integrations involving separate service costs. If you have subscribed to the Enterprise plan, you will receive complimentary credits on a monthly basis proportionate to the count of user licenses you have purchased. Automations across Zoho apps will first consume any [complimentary credits](https://www.zoho.com/sign/automation-credits.html) available in your account and will require purchase of additional Zoho Sign credits only upon their exhaustion. If you have subscribed to the [API-only plan](https://www.zoho.com/sign/pricing-api.html), you will need to purchase Zoho Sign credits to get documents signed as there is no other associated subscription cost. Envelopes sent via API or third-party apps always consume Zoho Sign credits irrespective of your subscription plan.\n    \n\nSign documents digitally.\n-------------------------\n\n[Get Started
