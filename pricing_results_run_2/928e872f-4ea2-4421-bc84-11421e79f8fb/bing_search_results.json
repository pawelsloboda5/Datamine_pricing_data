Our platform manages everything from uploads and storage to processing and delivery and is tailor-made for handling high volumes of user-generated content such as images, videos, documents and more. Uploadcare is connected to multiple CDNs and optimized with the latest industry standards for peak performance.\n\nWe also provide extensive APIs and management tools, making it straightforward to integrate Uploadcare with both new and existing web and mobile apps.\n\nUploadcare is a part of PandaDoc, Zapier, Buffer and many other products, apps and websites that you may have used or visited before. Check out our [customers\u2019 stories](https://uploadcare.com/customers/).\n\nAbsolutely! We\u2019ll price-match your current contracts with CDN and other vendors, and migrate you for free! [Get in touch](https://uploadcare.com/schedule-demo/) with our sales team to learn more.\n\nIt usually takes anywhere from 5 mins to a few days, depending on your use case. We offer ready-made libraries for all popular frameworks and follow the API-first approach. Plus, everyone on the Uploadcare customer support team is an engineer, so they can actually help you to build something cool!\n\nUploadcare works with multiple CDNs including Cloudfront, Akamai and Fastly. [Get in touch](https://uploadcare.com/schedule-demo/) if you want to migrate your current contract or use another CDN.\n\nYes, but only with a custom plan. [Get in touch](https://uploadcare.com/schedule-demo/) with our team to discuss the details.\n\nUploadcare supports any file types: images, videos or documents, up to 5TB each.\n\nUploadcare has built-in integrations with more than ten cloud storage services and social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram. Your users can choose files from anywhere to upload to your platform. And, if you work with sensitive content, you can set up your own apps so your users will feel safer when they provide access to their files.\n\nOperations are various actions associated with your files and API usage. Actions like uploading a file, making requests, or requesting transformations on your images are considered operations. Different actions have different operation costs, If you\u2019re curious about more information on how operations are calculated you can read [this article](https://uploadcare.com/docs/billing/).\n\nIn Uploadcare, \u201cTraffic\u201d refers to the data transferred both from Uploadcare CDN to your end-users and between Uploadcare CDN and Uploadcare\u2019s servers.\n\nUploadcare offers image and video optimization tools, which are quite handy because they help you significantly reduce your traffic usage. By optimizing your files, you\u2019re essentially reducing the file size without noticeably affecting the quality, meaning less data needs to be transferred, hence, less traffic used.\n\nWhen it comes to Storage in Uploadcare, it\u2019s all about the total size of the original files stored in your account. This includes every single image, video, document, or other type of file that you\u2019ve uploaded to Uploadcare. Unlike in some other systems, only the original versions of your files count towards your storage \u2014 not any transformations or alterations you might have made.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this metric is cumulative, meaning it adds up over time. The storage counter doesn\u2019t reset at the start of a new billing cycle.\n\nYes, the Demo plan is free of charge. It is designed to allow users to explore and experience the features and capabilities of Uploadcare without any cost. However, it\u2019s important to note that the Demo plan may have certain limitations compared to our paid subscription plans. If you require additional information about the specific features and limitations of the Demo plan, feel free to contact Uploadcare\u2019s [sales team](https://uploadcare.com/schedule-demo/).\n\nThe Demo plan is meant to give you a taste of Uploadcare\u2019s features for free, but going over the limits will result in a suspension until the next month begins. To avoid any interruptions in your account, we suggest upgrading to one of our paid plans. This will provide you with more generous limits and ensure uninterrupted usage.\n\nWe charge for our services through a subscription model. There are two types of fees: Subscription Fees and Usage Fees. The Subscription Fee is paid upfront when you sign up and covers a certain amount of usage for the chosen monthly or annual period.\n\nIf you exceed the allowed usage limits in your subscription plan, we will charge Usage Fees at the end of each month.\n\nFor more detailed information on the terms and conditions, including the Order Form, taxes, and refund policies, please refer to the full [terms of service](https://uploadcare.com/about/terms/) provided by Uploadcare.\n\nUploadcare limits are soft, and if you go above them, overage fees will apply automatically. Please [contact us](https://uploadcare.com/schedule-demo/) to discuss a plan which aligns best with your needs.\n\nUploadcare currently accepts major credit and debit cards for payment. In addition, if you\u2019re subscribed to the Enterprise plan, you also have the option to make payments via bank transfers.\n\nPlease note, alternatives like PayPal, Bitcoin, and similar methods are not currently supported. If you need further information or assistance with payment methods, feel free to get in touch with Uploadcare\u2019s [sales team](https://uploadcare.com/schedule-demo/).\n\nUploadcare values your ownership rights and privacy. All files and data you upload to Uploadcare remain your property. You maintain ownership of your files and data, and Uploadcare merely acts as a service provider to store and handle your files based on your instructions.\n\nYes, Uploadcare is SOC2 and HIPAA-compliant, ensuring that industry-standard security measures are in place to protect your files and data. As a trusted file management service, Uploadcare prioritizes the security and integrity of your information.\n\nUploadcare provides a 99.9% Service Level Agreement (SLA) on all paid plans, ensuring high availability and reliability of the services. Additionally, Uploadcare systems maintain over 99.99% monthly uptime figures for most regions.\n\nFor more specific details about Uploadcare\u2019s security certifications, compliance standards, and the SLA, check out the [Trust Center](https://uploadcare.com/about/trust/).\n\nThe cost is based on the number of resolution options and the duration of the video. Each resolution is billed separately.\n\n*   Each 10 seconds of video requires 20 operations.\n*   The duration is rounded up to the nearest 10 seconds.\n\nFor example, a 52-second video with three resolutions (360p, 720p, 1080p) requires: (6 \u00d7 20 operations) \u00d7 3 resolutions = 360 operations\n\nThere are three resolution options: 360p, 720p, and 1080p.\n\n*   The resolution is based on the smaller side of the video.\n*   Videos are never upscaled; if the original video is 900p, the highest resolution will remain 900p.\n*   If the original video is smaller than 720p or 1080p, those resolutions will not be created.\n\nVideo durations are rounded up to the nearest 10-second increment. For instance:\n\n*   A 52-second video is rounded up to 60 seconds.\n*   Billing is then calculated based on this rounded duration.\n\nNo, the resolution options depend on the original video\u2019s quality:\n\n*   If the original video is smaller than a resolution option (e.g., 720p or 1080p), those resolutions are not generated. This ensures no unnecessary upscaling in processing.\n\nFlexible pricing for companies and individual developers.",
