Twilio SendGrid manages the technical details of email delivery, like infrastructure scaling, ISP outreach, reputation monitoring, and real-time analytics.\n\nLearn more:\u00a0[Getting Started with Email API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/api-getting-started/)\n\n### How does the free trial work?\n\nOnce you create a [sender identity](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity/), you can send up to 100 emails per day and store up to 100 contacts on both the SendGrid Email API and the Marketing Campaigns trial. The trial will last for 60 days, after which you can upgrade to a paid plan after completing account setup.\n\n### Do I have to sign up for the Marketing Campaigns and Email API separately?\n\nYes! If you want to use Marketing Campaigns and the Email API, you will need to purchase the plans separately. But once you sign up, you can use the same account to send via the Email API or through Marketing Campaigns.\n\nLearn more:\u00a0[How to Send Email With Marketing Campaigns](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html)\n\n### Why are the email marketing pricing and email API pricing plans different?\n\nOur Email API and Marketing Campaigns products provide different features and functionality.\n\nMarketing Campaigns is designed for users who need robust, ready-to-use tools for managing email campaigns. It offers features like drag-and-drop design, list management, and comprehensive analytics to monitor campaign effectiveness. The email campaign pricing is tailored to marketers focusing on engagement and long-term customer relationships.\n\nOur Email API plan caters to developers looking to integrate email functionality directly into their applications or websites, offering maximum flexibility and control over how emails are sent and managed. The Email API plan is priced based on the volume of emails sent (and additional tools like Email Validation and Dedicated IPs) to accommodate the varying needs of apps from startups to large enterprises.\n\n### How do you measure the number of emails I send?\n\nEvery time you send one email to one recipient, it\u2019s deducted as one email credit from your Email API plan. This occurs whether the email is ultimately deferred or sent to spam by the inbox provider.\n\nAlso note that emails you send via Marketing Campaigns will be counted separately from any emails you send via the Email API.\n\nLearn more about the billing structure:\u00a0[Billing Info and FAQs](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/billing/)\n\n### What happens if I go over my plan?\n\nIf you send more emails than your plan allows within a given billing period, you will be charged a small overage fee on a per-email basis. Any overage fees are added to your invoice for the following billing period.\n\nLearn more about overage costs:\u00a0[Overages](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/billing/#overages)\n\n**Get started**\n\nStart sending email with SendGrid for free\n------------------------------------------\n\nSign up for a free trial to experience SendGrid\u2019s reliable, scalable email delivery.\n\n[Start for free](https://signup.sendgrid.com/) [Contact sales](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/contact-us-form)\n\n![Image 19: Start sending email with SendGrid for free](https://sendgrid.com/content/dam/sendgrid/global/en/1_homepage/illo-start-sending-email-with-SendGrid.png/_jcr_content/renditions/compressed-original.webp)\n\n![Image 20](https://sendgrid.com/content/dam/sendgrid/global/en/1_homepage/illo-start-sending-email-with-SendGrid.png/_jcr_content/renditions/compressed-original.webp)\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Email Marketing](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-marketing)\n*   [Email API](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-api)\n*   [Twilio Programmable SMS](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/messaging/channels/sms)\n*   [Expert Services](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/expert-services)\n*   [One Platform Solution](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions)\n*   [Pricing](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/pricing)\n\n[View all products](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions)\n\n### SendGrid is For\n\n*   [Startups](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/solutions/startups-resources)\n*   [Enterprises](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/enterprise)\n*   [High Volume Senders](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/contact)\n*   [Marketers](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-marketing)\n*   [Ecommerce](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/ecommerce)\n*   [Developers](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-api)\n\n[Our customers](https://customers.twilio.com/en-us/sendgrid?page=1&products=email%2Cmarketing-campaigns)\n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Guides](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/resources/guides)\n*   [Blog](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/blog)\n*   [Videos & Podcasts](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/resources/videos-podcasts)\n*   [Webcasts](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/resources/webcasts)\n*   [Knowledge Center](https://docs.sendgrid.com/)\n*   [Status](https://status.sendgrid.com/)\n\n[Contact support](https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us)\n\n### Developers\n\n*   [Start in 5 minutes](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/api-getting-started)\n*   [API Reference](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/authentication)\n*   [SMTP Service](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-api/smtp-service)\n*   [Libraries](https://github.com/sendgrid)\n*   [Event Webhook](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/event)\n*   [Integration & Partners](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/partners)\n\n[Go to docs](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers)\n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Twilio SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/why-sendgrid)\n*   [Our Team](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/company#the-team)\n*   [Our Customers](https://customers.twilio.com/en-us/sendgrid?page=1&products=email%2Cmarketing-campaigns)\n*   [Careers at Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/company/jobs)\n*   [Twilio Press & Media](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/press)\n*   [Trust & Security](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/policies/security)\n\n[Contact us](https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us)\n\n* * *\n\n[Sitemap](https://www.sendgrid.com/sitemap.xml) [Privacy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/privacy) [Terms](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/tos)\n\nCopyright 2025 SendGrid\n\n*   [](https://twitter.com/sendgrid)\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sendgrid)\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/SendGrid)\n\nSign up to send transactional and marketing email.

Twilio SendGrid manages the technical details of email delivery, like infrastructure scaling, ISP outreach, reputation monitoring, and real-time analytics.\n\nLearn more:\u00a0[Getting Started with Email API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/api-getting-started/)\n\n### How does the free trial work?\n\nOnce you create a [sender identity](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity/), you can send up to 100 emails per day and store up to 100 contacts on both the SendGrid Email API and the Marketing Campaigns trial. The trial will last for 60 days, after which you can upgrade to a paid plan after completing account setup.\n\n### Do I have to sign up for the Marketing Campaigns and Email API separately?\n\nYes! If you want to use Marketing Campaigns and the Email API, you will need to purchase the plans separately. But once you sign up, you can use the same account to send via the Email API or through Marketing Campaigns.\n\nLearn more:\u00a0[How to Send Email With Marketing Campaigns](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html)\n\n### Why are the email marketing pricing and email API pricing plans different?\n\nOur Email API and Marketing Campaigns products provide different features and functionality.\n\nMarketing Campaigns is designed for users who need robust, ready-to-use tools for managing email campaigns. It offers features like drag-and-drop design, list management, and comprehensive analytics to monitor campaign effectiveness. The email campaign pricing is tailored to marketers focusing on engagement and long-term customer relationships.\n\nOur Email API plan caters to developers looking to integrate email functionality directly into their applications or websites, offering maximum flexibility and control over how emails are sent and managed. The Email API plan is priced based on the volume of emails sent (and additional tools like Email Validation and Dedicated IPs) to accommodate the varying needs of apps from startups to large enterprises.\n\n### How do you measure the number of emails I send?\n\nEvery time you send one email to one recipient, it\u2019s deducted as one email credit from your Email API plan. This occurs whether the email is ultimately deferred or sent to spam by the inbox provider.\n\nAlso note that emails you send via Marketing Campaigns will be counted separately from any emails you send via the Email API.\n\nLearn more about the billing structure:\u00a0[Billing Info and FAQs](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/billing/)\n\n### What happens if I go over my plan?\n\nIf you send more emails than your plan allows within a given billing period, you will be charged a small overage fee on a per-email basis. Any overage fees are added to your invoice for the following billing period.\n\nLearn more about overage costs:\u00a0[Overages](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/billing/#overages)\n\n**Get started**\n\nStart sending email with SendGrid for free\n------------------------------------------\n\nSign up for a free trial to experience SendGrid\u2019s reliable, scalable email delivery.\n\n[Start for free](https://signup.sendgrid.com/) [Contact sales](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/contact-us-form)\n\n![Image 19: Start sending email with SendGrid for free](https://www.sendgrid.com/content/dam/sendgrid/global/en/1_homepage/illo-start-sending-email-with-SendGrid.png/_jcr_content/renditions/compressed-original.webp)\n\n![Image 20](https://www.sendgrid.com/content/dam/sendgrid/global/en/1_homepage/illo-start-sending-email-with-SendGrid.png/_jcr_content/renditions/compressed-original.webp)\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Email Marketing](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-marketing)\n*   [Email API](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-api)\n*   [Twilio Programmable SMS](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/messaging/channels/sms)\n*   [Expert Services](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/expert-services)\n*   [One Platform Solution](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions)\n*   [Pricing](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/pricing)\n\n[View all products](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions)\n\n### SendGrid is For\n\n*   [Startups](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/solutions/startups-resources)\n*   [Enterprises](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/enterprise)\n*   [High Volume Senders](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/contact)\n*   [Marketers](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-marketing)\n*   [Ecommerce](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/ecommerce)\n*   [Developers](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-api)\n\n[Our customers](https://customers.twilio.com/en-us/sendgrid?page=1&products=email%2Cmarketing-campaigns)\n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Guides](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/resources/guides)\n*   [Blog](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/blog)\n*   [Videos & Podcasts](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/resources/videos-podcasts)\n*   [Webcasts](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/resources/webcasts)\n*   [Knowledge Center](https://docs.sendgrid.com/)\n*   [Status](https://status.sendgrid.com/)\n\n[Contact support](https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us)\n\n### Developers\n\n*   [Start in 5 minutes](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/api-getting-started)\n*   [API Reference](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/authentication)\n*   [SMTP Service](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/solutions/email-api/smtp-service)\n*   [Libraries](https://github.com/sendgrid)\n*   [Event Webhook](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/event)\n*   [Integration & Partners](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/partners)\n\n[Go to docs](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers)\n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Twilio SendGrid](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/why-sendgrid)\n*   [Our Team](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/company#the-team)\n*   [Our Customers](https://customers.twilio.com/en-us/sendgrid?page=1&products=email%2Cmarketing-campaigns)\n*   [Careers at Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/company/jobs)\n*   [Twilio Press & Media](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/press)\n*   [Trust & Security](https://www.sendgrid.com/en-us/policies/security)\n\n[Contact us](https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us)\n\n* * *\n\n[Sitemap](https://www.sendgrid.com/sitemap.xml) [Privacy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/privacy) [Terms](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/tos)\n\nCopyright 2025 SendGrid\n\n*   [](https://twitter.com/sendgrid)\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sendgrid)\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/SendGrid)\n\nSign up to send transactional and marketing email.
