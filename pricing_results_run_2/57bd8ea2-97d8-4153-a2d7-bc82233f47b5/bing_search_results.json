So that we can tell you what is suitable for your projects, we of course need some information\n\nWe'll answer all of\n\nyour\u00a0questions\n\nTry all features with your team.\n\n**Frequently asked**\n\n![Image 10](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6418f5bfe5bc0a3438109c1d/6756f1eb97ea37b39dda40bb_%3F.png)\n\nquestions\n\n&\n\n![Image 11](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6418f5bfe5bc0a3438109c1d/6756f1eaede203fe2fab70fa_tick.png)\n\nanswers\n\nWhere is our data hosted?\n\nawork is GDPR-compliant and is hosted on state of the art, ISO 27001 certified Microsoft servers in Germany. Besides you and, if necessary, our support technicians, no one has access to your data. This is made possible, amongst other technologies, through the encryption of all our databases. Please refer to our [privacy policy](https://www.awork.com/legal-and-privacy) for more details.\n\n\u200d\n\nHow secure is awork?\n\nWe place the utmost importance on data security, and our engineers keep awork up-to-date. Our databases store all client data in encrypted form and awork is only accessible via encrypted connections. We publish fixes and security updates at least daily and regularly update our server infrastructure. Additionally, we conduct external penetration tests to verify the security of our platform.\n\nCan we cancel any time?\n\nYes. If you cancel your account, you'll be responsible for charges incurred for that billing period, but you won't be charged again.\n\n\u200d\n\nDo we have to commit to a long-term contract?\n\nNope, you do not have to do that. You can choose to be billed monthly, annually, or bi-annually and cancel at any time. If you pick monthly billing and then cancel, you'll only be charged for the current billing period. However, if you pay for 12 or 24 months in advance, you can save some money.\n\n\u200d\n\nCan we add or remove single users?\n\nYes, you can add or remove users at any time. If you cancel individual users, you'll be responsible for charges incurred for that billing period, but you won't be charged again for those users.\n\nCan we upgrade or downgrade my subscription plan?\n\nYou can change plans whenever you want. If you switch to a lower-tier plan, you will be responsible for any charges incurred for the current billing period, but you won't be billed again for that plan. However, you will loose access to the higher-tier features at the end of your current billing period.\n\nAre there discounts for non-profit organizations?\n\nYes! We offer discounted or free licenses for non-profit and social projects. Please fill out \ud83d\udc49 [our application form](https://www.awork.com/pricing#), and we'll let you know if your project is eligible.\n\nDo we need to install anything to use awork?\n\nNo, you just need a modern browser to access awork on any device. We do also have a desktop app that you can install for even better performance and integration into your daily working environment. You can find all downloads here.\n\nCan we migrate data from other tools?\n\nAbsolutely! You can easily migrate data from your existing tools. Use our data importer, API, or contact us for more complex migrations, and we'll be happy to assist you.\n\n\u200d\n\nAre there any liabilities connected to signing up for the free trial?\n\nNo, you can try awork without any payment information. There are no liabilities associated with the free trial and it does not automatically renew.\n\nWhich payment methods are accepted?\n\nWe accept all major credit cards and direct debit transfers. In the Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans, you have the additional option to pay via invoice.\n\nWhat kind of customer support is available?\n\nWe offer support via email and live chat with quick responses within minutes. The Professional and above plans include additional phone support. With our Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans, you'll receive premium support with priority response and specialised assistance.\n\nDoes awork offer any training or onboarding resources for new users?\n\nYes! We actually offer something even more powerful: our [team on board guarantee](https://www.awork.com/sales/onboarding-packages) - if you follow our established onboarding process (incl. personal training sessions), we guarantee that your team will use awork actively.\n\nAdditionally, we offer custom onboarding and implementation packages with our consulting teams for our Enterprise customers. Please [contact us](https://www.awork.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#483b29242d3b08293f273a23662b2725) to talk about the specifics (technical requirements, team-size, timeline, etc.).\n\nDo you offer staggered prices?\n\nYes, starting from 50 users already, we offer quantity discounts. Please feel free to schedule a call with us about it [here.](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/awork/awork-advice-questions?uuid=9dfdd38f-96bb-49cd-904a-1469b3b7424a)\n\nDo you offer a \u201c30 day money-back guarantee\u201d?\n\nWe\u2019re confident you\u2019ll love awork. But if your team feels otherwise, you can get a full refund within the first 30 days of a Basic, Standard or Professional subscription - no questions asked.\n\nTry awork for free for 14 day. After that you can choose the pricing plan that fits your team's needs best - starting from 8\u20ac per user per month.",
