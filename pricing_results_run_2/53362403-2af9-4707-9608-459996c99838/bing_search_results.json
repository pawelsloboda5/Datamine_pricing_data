PostHog will let me diagnose what problems users are having, which is invaluable when traffic is limited\n\n**Genuienly the single best analytics solution i have used.**\n\n**What do you like best about PostHog?**\n\nPosthog is incredibly simple to set up, and the separate features that it has all integrate with both each other and my codebase perfectly, with little-to-no effort.\n\n**What do you dislike about PostHog?**\n\nDelay. My only genuine problem with posthog is that events often take a while to reach the server after they are sent from the client.\n\n**What problems is PostHog solving and how is that benefiting you?**\n\nPosthog is helping us catch errors in our application, and see why/where users are having issues.\n\n**Accessible enterprise grade analytics**\n\n**What do you like best about PostHog?**\n\nPostHog has been a fantastic surprise. I initially expected it to be a heavy and complex analytics tool, but it turned out to be incredibly accessible\u2014especially for early-stage projects. The setup was straightforward and fast, and it integrated seamlessly with my Next.js app, performing far better than expected. What really stands out is how complete the platform is. It has every feature I could need\u2014from product analytics to session replays, feature flags, A/B testing, and more\u2014all in one place. Usually, you need to string together multiple tools to get this level of insight, but PostHog just delivers everything out of the box without feeling bloated. It\u2019s rare to find a tool this powerful that still feels lightweight and developer-friendly. Highly recommended for startups and scale-ups alike.\n\n**What do you dislike about PostHog?**\n\nIf I had to pick something, it would be the documentation. It\u2019s not bad by any means, but I think it could be a bit better organized and more detailed in some areas\u2014especially for edge cases or advanced use. That said, this is really just nitpicking.\n\n**What problems is PostHog solving and how is that benefiting you?**\n\nPostHog helps us cover multiple crucial areas in one place\u2014product analytics, web analytics, and session replays. Instead of juggling separate tools, we get a unified view of how users interact with our app. The ability to replay sessions has been especially valuable for understanding UX issues and refining the user journey. Overall, it\u2019s helped us make more informed product decisions and build a better experience based on real user behavior.\n\n### Pricing calculator\n\n### Estimate your price\n\nEvent types, explained\n\nEvents are billed at different rates based on volume and if you choose to send custom user properties with the event.\n\n### Anonymous events\n\n![Image 10: Anonymous event example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1/posthog.com/src/components/Pricing/PricingCalculator/Tabs/event-anonymous)\n\n### Anonymous events\n\nNo individually-identifiable info, analyzed in aggregate, don't use person profiles\n\nBy default, events are anonymous, meaning they don't have any personally-identifiable information attached to them.\n\nThey come with info about the browser and device, visitor's location, and any UTM parameters.\n\n#### With anonymous events, you can:\n\n*   See a Google Analytics-style dashboard\n*   Access properties like UTMs, location, referrer, page views\n*   Create **_aggregate_** insights in **Product analytics**\n    \n    *   How many times users click an element on a page\n    *   Group visitors by device type or location\n    *   Filter to interactions on a specific page\n    *   Track anonymous users across sessions\n\nPricing starts at\n\n**$0.00005**/event\n\nFirst 1 million events/mo free\n\n### Identified events\n\n![Image 11: Identified event example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1/posthog.com/src/components/Pricing/PricingCalculator/Tabs/event-identified)\n\n### Identified events\n\nTrack usage of specific, logged in users by using [person profiles](https://posthog.com/docs/data/persons).\n\nIdentify users by their email address or other unique identifier, and attach custom properties to their person profiles.\n\n#### In addition to anonymous event capabilities, you can:\n\n*   Merge anonymous users with their eventual identified user\n    \n    *   Like when they sign up for your product or use different devices - enables analyzing the user's path\n*   Store custom properties on users\n    \n    *   Use these properties in cohorts, session replay, experiments, and feature flags\n*   Create **_user-specific_** insights in **Product analytics**\n    \n    *   How many times _specific users_ click an element on a page\n    *   Group _cohorts of users_ by device type, location, or property\n    *   Filter to interactions on a specific page _by specific users_\n\nPricing starts at\n\n**$0.000248**/event\n\nFirst 1 million events/mo free\n\nFirst 1,000,000 events free \u2013 every month!\n\n### Event usage\n\nEvents/mo\n\nProduct analytics\n\nIdentified events\n\n01M10M50M250M\n\nWebsite analytics\n\nAnonymous events\n\n01M10M50M250M\n\nMobile app\n\n\\--\n\nLLM events\n\n\\--\n\nAPI events\n\n\\--\n\nOther events\n\n\\--\n\nProduct add-ons\n\n*   Group analytics\n    \n    Starts at\n    \n    **$0.000071**/event\n    \n    $0\n    \n*   Data pipelines\n    \n    Starts at\n    \n    **$0.000062**/event\n    \n    $0\n    \n\n**$0**\n\n#### Platform add-ons\n\nTeams\n\n**$450**/mo\n\n$0\n\n### Estimated total\n\nfor all products & add-ons\n\n$0\n\n#### How our pricing works\n\n*   Only pay for products you use\n*   **Generous free tier for each product (resets monthly)**\n*   You can set billing limits per product so you never get a surprise bill\n*   We also offer **discounts** for startups and non-profits\n\n#### Estimating usage\n\n*   Not sure what your volume looks like?
