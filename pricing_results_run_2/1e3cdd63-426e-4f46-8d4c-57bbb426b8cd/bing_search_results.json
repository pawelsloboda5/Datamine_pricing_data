[Contact us](mailto:support@creatomate.com)\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\nHow many credits do I need?\n\nOne image is always one credit. One minute of video at 720p (25 fps) is about 14 credits, so Growth (10,000) gets you about 12 hours of video. In our [documentation](https://creatomate.com/docs/account-billing/credit-calculation), we explain how many credits a video costs based on its resolution, frame rate, and length.\n\nWhat counts as storage?\n\nThe media (such as images, videos, audio clips) in your templates and feeds is considered storage. Renders you generate are not considered storage, but they are automatically deleted after 30 days.\n\nWhat are feed rows?\n\nWith Creatomate, you are able to bulk-generate videos & banners [using spreadsheets](https://creatomate.com/bulk-generation), which are also referred to as feeds. Your subscription plan determines the maximum number of rows you can have in your account.\n\nWhat is project sharing?\n\nProject sharing allows you to add team members to a single paid subscription. Team members can be restricted from accessing feeds or templates. It's also possible to restrict credit usage per project.\n\nWhat is the JS Preview SDK?\n\nThe [JavaScript Preview SDK](https://creatomate.com/javascript-video-sdk) allows you to embed Creatomate's renderer in your own web applications. By doing so, you'll be able to provide your users with the ability to preview or edit videos before rendering. This feature is available starting with the Growth plans. Note that the [API](https://creatomate.com/developers) is available on all plans.\n\nHow does the free trial work?\n\nYou can try out Creatomate and all its features for free with 50 API credits. No credit card or additional information is required. Simply create your account and start right away.\n\nHow do I get more credits if I run out?\n\nIf you temporarily need additional credits, you may upgrade to a higher plan, and then downgrade whenever you want. The higher plan will remain in effect for the remainder of the billing period.\n\nCan I change my plan anytime?\n\nYes. Changing your subscription can be done at any time through your dashboard, whether you want to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel.\n\nWhere can I find more information?\n\nOur [documentation](https://creatomate.com/docs/getting-started) may contain the answer to your question. In addition, please feel free to contact us at [support@creatomate.com](mailto:support@creatomate.com) whenever you need assistance.\n\nStart automating today\n----------------------\n\nStart with a
