The Free plan is designed for teams just starting out with visual collaboration: you can invite as many team members and create as many boards as you want, but only 3 boards will be active and editable at once. For more advanced collaboration functionality, check out our Starter, Business or Enterprise plans.\n\n### **What is included with the Free plan?**\n\nThe Free plan enables you to experience the power of visual collaboration firsthand: with unlimited team members, 3 active boards, and access to all our pre-built templates as well as a set of robust integrations including Google Drive, Slack, and more.\n\n### **Can I change the team size?**\n\nYes, you can change your team size at any point during your subscription. You\u2019ll be charged a prorated fee for adding new users and a refund on your next payment for removing users.\n\n### **How can I increase Miro AI credits?**\n\nMiro AI credits are calculated based on the number of licenses in the organisation and your Miro plan (Starter/Business/Enterprise).
