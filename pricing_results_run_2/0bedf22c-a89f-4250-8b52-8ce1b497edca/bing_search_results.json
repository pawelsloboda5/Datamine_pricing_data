Once the trial ends, you will know the number of identified companies that you can match with our pricing tiers. With it we will find the solution and price that works best for you.\n\n##### Is the use of Leadinfo legal under the GDPR?\n\nYes, the use of Leadinfo is legal under the GDPR, which was introduced as a European privacy law on 25 May 2018.\n\nLeadinfo matches the IP address of the visitor against a publicly available database of company data (such as the Chamber of Commerce). According to the GDPR, the IP address is considered to be private data, and there must be solid justification for its use. The justification is \u2018own legitimate interest\u2019, provided for in Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. This article states working with personal data is permitted if this serves a clear interest and privacy standards are maintained.\n\nMarketing and analytics are considered to be legitimate interests, and Leadinfo only uses private data in a limited capacity. IP addresses are not saved and only publicly accessible corporate data is shared with the users. This means that Leadinfo maintains privacy standards. As a Leadinfo user, you are obliged to state these facts in your company\u2019s privacy statement, as well as the register of data processing operations.\n\n##### Am I committed to anything if I start the 14-day trial period?\n\nNo, the 14-day trial is completely free and non-binding. After the trial, you can decide whether you want to subscribe.\n\n##### What if I don\u2019t know how many companies I need to identify?\n\nNo worries! If you\u2019re unsure about the number of companies to identify, you can always start with a lower limit and upgrade later as you want to collect more leads. Our support team is happy to help you choose the right plan based on your website traffic and goals. This way, you only pay for what you actually need!\n\n##### Can I adjust my subscription?\n\nYes, you can easily upgrade or downgrade your subscription to match the needs of your business. Whether you want to upgrade to a larger plan or downgrade, you can easily adjust your plan to match your business needs.\n\n##### What happens if I exceed my lead limit?\n\nIf you reach your lead limit, Leadinfo will continue collecting leads but these will not be visible to you. You can upgrade to a higher plan to continue without limits.\n\n##### How do I install the Leadinfo tracking code on my website?\n\nYou can install the tracking code by adding the code manually to your website, use Google Tag Manager or use our plug-ins for WordPress, Joomla!, Shopware, Wix, Squarespace or Drupal.\n\nImplement Leadinfo today\n------------------------\n\nAnd transform anonymous website visitors into customers\n\n   \n\nSign up for free\n\n*   No payment details required\n*   GDPR-compliant\n*   Trusted by 15.000+ users\n\n[![Image 9](https://www.leadinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Leadinfo_Logo_1024.png)](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/)\n\nProduct\n\n[Product](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/lead-generation/reveal-high-quality-leads/)\n\n[Integrations](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/integrations/)\n\n[Pricing](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/pricing/)\n\n[Customers](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/customers/)\n\n[Free trial](https://portal.leadinfo.com/registration)\n\n[Compare](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/compare/)\n\nSupport\n\n[Blog](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/blog/)\n\n[Resources](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/resources/)\n\n[Expert content](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/content/)\n\n[GDPR](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/gdpr/)\n\n[Help Center](https://help.leadinfo.com/en)\n\n[Contact us](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/contact/)\n\nCompany\n\n[About Leadinfo](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/about-leadinfo/)\n\n[Team](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/team/)\n\n[Partner Program](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/partners/)\n\n[Jobs](https://jobs.leadinfo.com/en)\n\n[Terms & Conditions](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/eula/)[Privacy Policy](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/privacy/)[Opt-out](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/opt-out/)\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025 Leadinfo\n\n               \n\n![Image 10: logo](https://www.leadinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Leadinfo_Logo_1024.png)\n\n\u00d7\n\nWe (Leadinfo) and selected third parties (1) use cookies or similar technologies for technical purposes and, with your consent, for **functionality, experience, measurement and \u201cmarketing (personalized ads)\u201d** as specified in the [cookie policy](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/privacy/).\n\nYou can freely give, deny, or withdraw your consent at any time by accessing the preferences panel.

With it we will find the solution and price that works best for you.\n\n##### Is the use of Leadinfo legal under the GDPR?\n\nYes, the use of Leadinfo is legal under the GDPR, which was introduced as a European privacy law on 25 May 2018.\n\nLeadinfo matches the IP address of the visitor against a publicly available database of company data (such as the Chamber of Commerce). According to the GDPR, the IP address is considered to be private data, and there must be solid justification for its use. The justification is \u2018own legitimate interest\u2019, provided for in Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. This article states working with personal data is permitted if this serves a clear interest and privacy standards are maintained.\n\nMarketing and analytics are considered to be legitimate interests, and Leadinfo only uses private data in a limited capacity. IP addresses are not saved and only publicly accessible corporate data is shared with the users. This means that Leadinfo maintains privacy standards. As a Leadinfo user, you are obliged to state these facts in your company\u2019s privacy statement, as well as the register of data processing operations.\n\n##### Am I committed to anything if I start the 14-day trial period?\n\nNo, the 14-day trial is completely free and non-binding. After the trial, you can decide whether you want to subscribe.\n\n##### What if I don\u2019t know how many companies I need to identify?\n\nNo worries! If you\u2019re unsure about the number of companies to identify, you can always start with a lower limit and upgrade later as you want to collect more leads. Our support team is happy to help you choose the right plan based on your website traffic and goals. This way, you only pay for what you actually need!\n\n##### Can I adjust my subscription?\n\nYes, you can easily upgrade or downgrade your subscription to match the needs of your business. Whether you want to upgrade to a larger plan or downgrade, you can easily adjust your plan to match your business needs.\n\n##### What happens if I exceed my lead limit?\n\nIf you reach your lead limit, Leadinfo will continue collecting leads but these will not be visible to you. You can upgrade to a higher plan to continue without limits.\n\n##### How do I install the Leadinfo tracking code on my website?\n\nYou can install the tracking code by adding the code manually to your website, use Google Tag Manager or use our plug-ins for WordPress, Joomla!, Shopware, Wix, Squarespace or Drupal.\n\nImplement Leadinfo today\n------------------------\n\nAnd transform anonymous website visitors into customers\n\n   \n\nSign up for free\n\n*   No payment details required\n*   GDPR-compliant\n*   Trusted by 15.000+ users\n\n[![Image 9](https://www.leadinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Leadinfo_Logo_1024.png)](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/)\n\nProduct\n\n[Product](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/lead-generation/reveal-high-quality-leads/)\n\n[Integrations](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/integrations/)\n\n[Pricing](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/pricing/)\n\n[Customers](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/customers/)\n\n[Free trial](https://portal.leadinfo.com/registration)\n\n[Compare](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/compare/)\n\nSupport\n\n[Blog](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/blog/)\n\n[Resources](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/resources/)\n\n[Expert content](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/content/)\n\n[GDPR](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/gdpr/)\n\n[Help Center](https://help.leadinfo.com/en)\n\n[Contact us](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/contact/)\n\nCompany\n\n[About Leadinfo](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/about-leadinfo/)\n\n[Team](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/team/)\n\n[Partner Program](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/partners/)\n\n[Jobs](https://jobs.leadinfo.com/en)\n\n[Terms & Conditions](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/eula/)[Privacy Policy](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/privacy/)[Opt-out](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/opt-out/)\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025 Leadinfo\n\n               \n\n![Image 10: logo](https://www.leadinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Leadinfo_Logo_1024.png)\n\n\u00d7\n\nWe (Leadinfo) and selected third parties (1) use cookies or similar technologies for technical purposes and, with your consent, for **functionality, experience, measurement and \u201cmarketing (personalized ads)\u201d** as specified in the [cookie policy](https://www.leadinfo.com/en/legal/privacy/).\n\nYou can freely give, deny, or withdraw your consent at any time by accessing the preferences panel.
