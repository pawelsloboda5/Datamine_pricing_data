That\u2019s why we made it super easy to enjoy bunq with your friends, family or partner(s)! By starting your own bunq Pack, you can share the bunq experience with up to 3 other people: It\u2019s possible to have a bunq Pack with a up to 4 bunq bunq Pro Personal/ bunq Elite Personal accounts or 3 bunq bunq Pro Personal/ bunq Elite Personal accounts and 1 bunq bunq Pro Business/ bunq Elite Business account. This includes the account of the Pack owner. \n\nThe bunq Pack owner is the user who initiated the formation of the Pack. Only the Pack owner will be invoiced for the Pack fee. The other members of a Pack will not be invoiced for their respective monthly account fees as long as they stay members of the Pack. If a Pack member upgrades to bunq Elite Personal or bunq EliteBusiness, he/she will be charged only for the difference between bunq Pro Personal and bunq Elite Personal or between bunq Pro Business and bunq Elite Business fees. All other charges will be invoiced normally. \n\nBy way of illustration, a bunq bunq Pro Personal Pack member will not be charged \u20ac8.99 per month, but they will be charged if they order a replacement card or make more than four withdrawals in one month. \n\nYou can leave a Pack anytime you want and every bunq Pack owner can terminate their Pack any time they want. If you leave a Pack, you can still access all the bunq features that make life easy and help you save time. Depending on your type of account we will apply bunq bunq Pro Personal or bunq bunq Pro Business pricing for you in case you leave a Pack or if the Pack you\u2019re in gets terminated. \n\nWe will automatically terminate a Pack if the Pack owner is in arrears with the monthly fee. \n\n\u2756 Billing \n\nIn case you order an extra or replacement card we will charge you \u20ac9.99. This amount will be debited from your billing account immediately. All running costs will be debited from your billing account once a month (on your billing date). \n\nWe will start billing for an extra card or extra bank accounts, on the  fi rst billing date following the activation of the extra card/the moment we received the order for the extra bank accounts. \n\n\u2756 Upgrade \n\nThe above mentioned pricing will apply to you immediately from the moment you upgrade. However, we will only start billing for the plan fee on the  fi rst billing date following the upgrade. \n\nWe will charge you the monthly fee for extra cards and/or accounts in case you upgrade and your number of cards and/or accounts exceeds the number included in your plan. \n\nBy way of illustration, imagine you have  fi ve active bunq cards and decide to upgrade to bunq bunq Pro Personal. Only three bunq cards are included in your bunq bunq Pro plan, so on top of the plan fee we will charge you a monthly fee per card for the two cards which exceed the included amount. \n\nOn the  fi rst billing date following an upgrade, we will count the number of withdrawals over the previous billing period (incl. any withdrawals made after the last billing but before the upgrade) and we will charge a fee for all withdrawals above the number of withdrawals included in your plan. \n\nBy way of illustration, imagine you made three withdrawals since your last billing date and subsequently you upgrade. After the upgrade you made another four withdrawals. On the next billing date we count a total of seven withdrawals. Four withdrawals are included in your plan, so we will charge you for three withdrawals. \n\n\u2756 Non-euro card payments and cash withdrawals For transactions executed in currencies other than euro, we convert the transaction amount to euro using the Mastercard exchange rates before we debit your account. This means the initial amount debited at the time of payment is an estimated amount, which may differ from the  fi nal amount after the payment is fully processed due to possible exchange rate  fl uctuations. If you want to check the current Mastercard exchange rates, please have a look at their website. \n\nWe may also apply a currency  fl uctuation prevention to your transaction. \n\n\u2756 Swift inbound transfers \n\nDepending on the volume of the amount of these payments, we charge inbound Swift costs. \n\n\u2756 Incidental special costs \n\nSometimes your incidental  fi nancial matters with a third party require us to get involved. Because this involvement requires time and effort from our side, we can charge you the costs we make in order to do our job. \n\n\u2756 Garnishments \n\nThird parties have the possibility to (preliminary or de fi nitely) extract funds from your account to repay an outstanding debt, for example due to unpaid taxes or open loans. These third parties require either a prior permit from a judge or a court order to put a garnishment of your accounts. As processing these garnishments is a dif fi cult and timely process, we charge you with the costs as described above. When you have a positive balance on your accounts, we will settle the balance with the costs. We will also charge you with the costs when there is no balance on the accounts. \n\n\u2756 Bank statements \n\nYour organisation may be required to provide a standard bank statement towards your audit  fi rm. To support your organisation with this, we can draft the required \n\nstatement in accordance with the format as provided by the NBA ( https://www.nba.nl/tools-en-voorbeelden/standaardbankverklaring/ ) in Dutch or English. When you \n\nrequest us to draft a standard bank statement for your account with us, we will charge you the applicable fee. \n\n\u2756 Mastercard Chargebacks \n\nChargebacks are situations in which you dispute a card payment you made. Please note that Mastercard can decide the dispute was unjusti fi ed (either before or after arbitration), for which the costs will be charged to you. Any additional costs charged by Mastercard for fraudulent or incorrect chargebacks (on top of the above-mentioned cases), we hold the right to pass these costs on to you when your case gives reason to do so. We want to stipulate that these costs can be substantial. For more information on these costs, please refer to the Mastercard Chargeback Guide. \n\nA \u20ac15 deposit will be deducted from your account, which will be returned after the chargeback process. In case of a false or unjust chargeback request, we may decide to retain the deposit. \n\n\u2756 Export of statements from a permanently closed account \n\nIf you would like to export a bank statement for an account that you have decided to close permanently, we are happy to help. However, since this requires a lot of time and \n\neffort on our side to make this happen, we will charge you a fee to export a bank statement for a permanently closed account. Please check  www.together.bunq.com  if you \n\nwould like to close your account through the app in a way that lets you export bank statements and avoid this fee. \u2756 API support for PSD2 developers \n\nWe want to provide PSD2-licensed developers with support when it comes to their app\u2019s connection to the bunq PSD2 API. Support can be acquired in packs of 10 hours. Our software will keep track of the hours of support you have used up. The purchased support hours are non-refundable. Support can be requested by sending an email to \n\napipartner@bunq.com. For an overview of what is and isn\u2019t included in this support package, see the relevant terms and conditions at  www.bunq.com/terms .\n\n\u2756 Stamp Duty for users residing in Ireland \n\nIn certain cases, we are required to collect stamp duty from you if you reside in Ireland. If you use a physical card, we are required to charge you a fee of \u20ac0,12 per cash withdrawal up to a maximum of \u20ac5 per year. This fee is charged once per year on the 31st of December. Collection of these stamp duties is mandatory and is governed by Revenue, the Irish tax service. For more information, please see their website. \n\n## Deposit Guarantee Scheme \n\n## In principle, every Euro in your bunq account is covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS). \n\n## This means that your credit is guaranteed up to EUR 100,000 per account holder. This guarantee \n\n## applies per banking license holder. For a complete overview of what falls under the Scheme \n\n## please check our  DGS information page  and the  Dutch Central Bank (DNB)  for more information.",

That\u2019s why we made it super easy to enjoy bunq with your friends, family or partner(s)! By starting your own bunq Pack, you can share the bunq experience with up to 3 other people: It\u2019s possible to have a bunq Pack with a up to 4 bunq bunq Pro Personal/ bunq Elite Personal accounts or 3 bunq bunq Pro Personal/ bunq Elite Personal accounts and 1 bunq bunq Pro Business/ bunq Elite Business account. This includes the account of the Pack owner. \n\nThe bunq Pack owner is the user who initiated the formation of the Pack. Only the Pack owner will be invoiced for the Pack fee. The other members of a Pack will not be invoiced for their respective monthly account fees as long as they stay members of the Pack. If a Pack member upgrades to bunq Elite Personal or bunq EliteBusiness, he/she will be charged only for the difference between bunq Pro Personal and bunq Elite Personal or between bunq Pro Business and bunq Elite Business fees. All other charges will be invoiced normally. \n\nBy way of illustration, a bunq bunq Pro Personal Pack member will not be charged \u20ac8.99 per month, but they will be charged if they order a replacement card or make more than four withdrawals in one month. \n\nYou can leave a Pack anytime you want and every bunq Pack owner can terminate their Pack any time they want. If you leave a Pack, you can still access all the bunq features that make life easy and help you save time. Depending on your type of account we will apply bunq bunq Pro Personal or bunq bunq Pro Business pricing for you in case you leave a Pack or if the Pack you\u2019re in gets terminated. \n\nWe will automatically terminate a Pack if the Pack owner is in arrears with the monthly fee. \n\n\u2756 Billing \n\nIn case you order an extra or replacement card we will charge you \u20ac9.99. This amount will be debited from your billing account immediately. All running costs will be debited from your billing account once a month (on your billing date). \n\nWe will start billing for an extra card or extra bank accounts, on the  fi rst billing date following the activation of the extra card/the moment we received the order for the extra bank accounts. \n\n\u2756 Upgrade \n\nThe above mentioned pricing will apply to you immediately from the moment you upgrade. However, we will only start billing for the plan fee on the  fi rst billing date following the upgrade. \n\nWe will charge you the monthly fee for extra cards and/or accounts in case you upgrade and your number of cards and/or accounts exceeds the number included in your plan. \n\nBy way of illustration, imagine you have  fi ve active bunq cards and decide to upgrade to bunq bunq Pro Personal. Only three bunq cards are included in your bunq bunq Pro plan, so on top of the plan fee we will charge you a monthly fee per card for the two cards which exceed the included amount. \n\nOn the  fi rst billing date following an upgrade, we will count the number of withdrawals over the previous billing period (incl. any withdrawals made after the last billing but before the upgrade) and we will charge a fee for all withdrawals above the number of withdrawals included in your plan. \n\nBy way of illustration, imagine you made three withdrawals since your last billing date and subsequently you upgrade. After the upgrade you made another four withdrawals. On the next billing date we count a total of seven withdrawals. Four withdrawals are included in your plan, so we will charge you for three withdrawals. \n\n\u2756 Non-euro card payments and cash withdrawals For transactions executed in currencies other than euro, we convert the transaction amount to euro using the Mastercard exchange rates before we debit your account. This means the initial amount debited at the time of payment is an estimated amount, which may differ from the  fi nal amount after the payment is fully processed due to possible exchange rate  fl uctuations. If you want to check the current Mastercard exchange rates, please have a look at their website. \n\nWe may also apply a currency  fl uctuation prevention to your transaction. \n\n\u2756 Swift inbound transfers \n\nDepending on the volume of the amount of these payments, we charge inbound Swift costs. \n\n\u2756 Incidental special costs \n\nSometimes your incidental  fi nancial matters with a third party require us to get involved. Because this involvement requires time and effort from our side, we can charge you the costs we make in order to do our job. \n\n\u2756 Garnishments \n\nThird parties have the possibility to (preliminary or de fi nitely) extract funds from your account to repay an outstanding debt, for example due to unpaid taxes or open loans. These third parties require either a prior permit from a judge or a court order to put a garnishment of your accounts. As processing these garnishments is a dif fi cult and timely process, we charge you with the costs as described above. When you have a positive balance on your accounts, we will settle the balance with the costs. We will also charge you with the costs when there is no balance on the accounts. \n\n\u2756 Bank statements \n\nYour organisation may be required to provide a standard bank statement towards your audit  fi rm. To support your organisation with this, we can draft the required \n\nstatement in accordance with the format as provided by the NBA ( https://www.nba.nl/tools-en-voorbeelden/standaardbankverklaring/ ) in Dutch or English. When you \n\nrequest us to draft a standard bank statement for your account with us, we will charge you the applicable fee. \n\n\u2756 Mastercard Chargebacks \n\nChargebacks are situations in which you dispute a card payment you made. Please note that Mastercard can decide the dispute was unjusti fi ed (either before or after arbitration), for which the costs will be charged to you. Any additional costs charged by Mastercard for fraudulent or incorrect chargebacks (on top of the above-mentioned cases), we hold the right to pass these costs on to you when your case gives reason to do so. We want to stipulate that these costs can be substantial. For more information on these costs, please refer to the Mastercard Chargeback Guide. \n\nA \u20ac15 deposit will be deducted from your account, which will be returned after the chargeback process. In case of a false or unjust chargeback request, we may decide to retain the deposit. \n\n\u2756 Export of statements from a permanently closed account \n\nIf you would like to export a bank statement for an account that you have decided to close permanently, we are happy to help. However, since this requires a lot of time and \n\neffort on our side to make this happen, we will charge you a fee to export a bank statement for a permanently closed account. Please check  www.together.bunq.com  if you \n\nwould like to close your account through the app in a way that lets you export bank statements and avoid this fee. \u2756 API support for PSD2 developers \n\nWe want to provide PSD2-licensed developers with support when it comes to their app\u2019s connection to the bunq PSD2 API. Support can be acquired in packs of 10 hours. Our software will keep track of the hours of support you have used up. The purchased support hours are non-refundable. Support can be requested by sending an email to \n\napipartner@bunq.com. For an overview of what is and isn\u2019t included in this support package, see the relevant terms and conditions at  www.bunq.com/terms .\n\n\u2756 Stamp Duty for users residing in Ireland \n\nIn certain cases, we are required to collect stamp duty from you if you reside in Ireland. If you use a physical card, we are required to charge you a fee of \u20ac0,12 per cash withdrawal up to a maximum of \u20ac5 per year. This fee is charged once per year on the 31st of December. Collection of these stamp duties is mandatory and is governed by Revenue, the Irish tax service. For more information, please see their website. \n\n## Deposit Guarantee Scheme \n\n## In principle, every Euro in your bunq account is covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS). \n\n## This means that your credit is guaranteed up to EUR 100,000 per account holder. This guarantee \n\n## applies per banking license holder. For a complete overview of what falls under the Scheme \n\n## please check our  DGS information page  and the  Dutch Central Bank (DNB)  for more information.",
