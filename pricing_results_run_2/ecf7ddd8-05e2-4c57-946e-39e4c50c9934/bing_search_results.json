For example, your plan may have an order limit which means that if you have a great year and your order volume exceeds that limit, your account will be auto-upgraded to the next level - if and when that happens, you will be notified by email letting you know.\nGenerally speaking, we recommend selecting the smallest plan that fits your needs. Then, as your sales grow, you can upgrade your plan to meet your growing needs or, if you exceed the order and sales limits for your plan, your account will be auto-upgraded. We will email you with full information of those updates.\n\n\nWhy did you change pricing?\n\n\nThis is the first major pricing change in the 15 year history of SendOwl and is being done to bring our pricing in line with the value we provide to our users and allow us to continue investing in providing industry leading products, features and service. With this pricing change, we are still at parity or (meaningfully) below many of our key competitors.\n\n\nHow does your pricing compare to the market?\n\n\nPlease see the comparison list above but, in short, SendOwl is still amazing value and is still cheaper than the majority of the listed alternatives.\n\n\nWhat about free orders?\n\n\nFree orders use the same resources to store files and the same bandwidth to deliver content as paid orders. In other words, free orders count towards your order total in the same way as paid orders.\nTest orders made using the Stripe test order configuration will not count towards your order total or sales total.\n\n\nWill my plan change?\n\n\nWe will automatically assign you the lowest cost new plan for your volume and features. Once plans are \u201clive\u201d on April 24, you can go to your account settings and adjust your plan.\n\n\nI am on a legacy plan, will I move?\n\n\nWe stopped supporting legacy plans several years ago and we \u2018grandfathered\u2019 those plans into SendOwl. However, all merchants will now move to the plan noted above that most closely aligns with their current usage.\n\n\nWill this impact my existing orders/subscriptions I sell?\n\n\nIn short, no. Your existing products will continue to be available as will your existing subscriptions. Remember that you will be moved to the plan that most closely aligns with your current usage and you will not lose functionality.\n\n\n\n\nLeading companies and growing creators choose SendOwl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet started\nfor free.Try SendOwl\n\nStay up to date with the latestSubscribe \n\nProduct\n\nPlatform\nPricing\n\nCompany\n\nAbout SendOwl\nReferral Program\nContact Us\n\nCommunity\n\nBlog\nHelp and Support\nDevelopers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct categories\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nCookies\n\nSendOwl makes it easy for you to sell digital products directly to your audience from your blog, social media or anywhere you can paste a link",
