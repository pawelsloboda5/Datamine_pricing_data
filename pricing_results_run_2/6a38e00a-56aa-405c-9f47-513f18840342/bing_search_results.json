'Inactive' clients are excluded. You choose whether a client is active or inactive by setting their status. Active & Lead clients can have bookings, make payments, login etc. Inactive clients cannot do any of these actions.\n\n![Image 20](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5d1f053cee3b9da3d699a858/5d1f053cee3b9d63af99a907_question-icon.svg)\n\n##### Can I\u00a0upgrade or downgrade my plan as my business changes?\n\nYes! Your plan will automatically scale up based on the number of 'Active' clients you have. 'Inactive' clients do not count towards your plan count. You decide whether a client is active or inactive, so make sure to keep your client list up to date. You can also upgrade or downgrade at any time manually. When a plan change happens, you will receive either a pro-rated charge or credit, depending on the price of your new plan.\n\n![Image 21](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5d1f053cee3b9da3d699a858/5d1f053cee3b9d63af99a907_question-icon.svg)\n\n##### Is my data secure?\n\nYes!
