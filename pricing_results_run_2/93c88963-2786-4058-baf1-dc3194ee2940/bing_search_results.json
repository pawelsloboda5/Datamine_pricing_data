We strive to be the sidekicks that help them \u2013 both our clients and our teammates. Don\u2019t take our word for it.\u00a0**[Read what other agents say about our support here](https://showcaseidx.com/idx-reviews/)**.\n\n**Want to know more about our team culture and approach to helping you? Read about\u00a0[our \u201cculture\u201d and \u201ccore values\u201d](https://showcaseidx.com/about-us/)**\u00a0\u2013 we live them and you can always remind us of them. We want to not just help you today but also build momentum for tomorrow.\n\nWe accept payments made online using Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express. We cannot accept any personal or business checks.\n\nWe only charge for service in USD (United States Dollar). For customers in Canada, please note that you will see a charge on your method of payment for more than the cost of the IDX on our website due to the exchange rate at the given time.\n\nYou can use Showcase IDX absolutely free for 10 days once we get your MLS paperwork approved from the MLS and send you everything you need to get started. That way you can experience the full IDX and home search tools with live MLS data.\n\nPrior to that, you can begin using the IDX plugin with demo data.\n\nWe don\u2019t ask that you give us a credit card until you\u2019re ready to commit to activating your account past your trial period.\n\nYou have a full 10-days from the start of your trial to use all the premium features of Showcase IDX. We even cover all your MLS pass-through fees for the 10 days and there are\u00a0**no setup fees whatsoever**.\n\nThere are no setup fees or long-term contracts with Showcase IDX.\n\nWe win your business with value and support, not long-term contracts or steep upfront payments.\n\n**Monthly**\u00a0Plans  \nNo. There is no set-term contract when you use Showcase IDX on a monthly plan, other than agreeing to our Terms of Service. You can cancel your account at any time and you will not be billed again. To cancel your account, send us an email and we\u2019ll take care of it.\n\nYearly Plans  \nWhen you sign up for a yearly plan, you are committing to that plan Showcase IDX for 12 months and\u00a0**you receive 12 months for the price of 10 months**. The level (Essentials or Premium) of the yearly plan cannot be switched during this term. If you choose to cancel before the end of your 12-month-term, we will refund a prorated amount representing the remainder of your 12-month-term, along with an early cancelation fee of $200 taken out of the prorated refund amount.\n\nMore and more MLS\u2019s require vendors like us to pay Data Access Fees that are passed through to the customer (you). These vary from $0/month up to $33/month. If we don\u2019t have to charge a pass-through fee, we don\u2019t. For the MLS you select, this will be clearly displayed on your sign up form, before you complete your sign up process. Although the rates may vary slightly, 99% of IDX companies charge these fees.\n\nYou can also see these on our MLS Coverage page.\n\nYes. You can purchase a license for additional sites and add additional users.\n\nOur Essentials plan includes 2 admin users and your Premium plan includes 5. It\u2019s also easy to add additional sites. If you\u2019re a broker or have a team and would like to provide a website for each member on your team, we can help you with that as well.\n\nThe Essentials plan includes 2 users. Additional users are:\n\n*   3-10 Users: $4/mo/user\n*   11-50 Users: $3/mo/user\n*   51-100 Users: $2.50/mo/user\n*   100-200 Users: $2.25/mo/user\n*   200+ Users: $2/mo/user\n\nThe Premium plan include 5 users. Additional users are:\n\n*   6-10 Users: $4/mo/user\n*   11-50 Users: $3/mo/user\n*   51-100 Users: $2.50/mo/user\n*   100-200 Users: $2.25/mo/user\n*   200+ Users: $2/mo/user\n\n**Showcase IDX was founded in 2003.**\u00a0Since then, we\u2019ve closed a private equity round and grown our team. Now, we\u2019re the leading IDX WordPress plugin for real estate and are growing faster than ever. We democratize technology for agents and brokers, creating innovative products that empower our customers to grow.\n\nIf you want to know more about our team, where we\u2019re based, or why we love coming to work, you can\u00a0[read more here](https://showcaseidx.com/about-us/).\n\nGreat question. Many of the agents and brokers that work with us do have web designer/developer already or are setting up their website themselves.\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with WordPress and how to update a theme, you can easily get started today.\n\n**We also see many agents and brokers that know that having the right IDX technology is critical to building your business and helping your clients. They often sign up first on our website and then contact one of our Showcase\u00a0[IDX Certified Partners](https://showcaseidx.com/agencies/)**\u00a0for help building their site and setting up modern real estate marketing processes. We also have a few partners that work specifically with websites on our\u00a0[approved real estate web designers](https://showcaseidx.com/custom-wordpress-real-estate-websites/)\u00a0list.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to sign up, you can set up time with our concierge team too and they can recommend a developer while you\u2019re MLS approval is processed. Either way, you\u2019re trial will not start until your MLS access is approved.\n\nWe do NOT build websites, instead we build the engines that power your website. This lets us focus on building the ONLY IDX and home search that consumers choose over Zillow.\n\nIf you need help building your website or customizing your existing website, talk to one of our\u00a0[Showcase IDX Certified Partners](https://showcaseidx.com/agencies/). These partners are the best of the best. They know modern real estate marketing.\u00a0**Each certified partner page shows you exactly what each partner specializes in and the budgets they help with**.\n\n**For web developers,**\u00a0know that we will not compete with you either. Other IDX vendors have begun building websites that compete with their partners. So, not only do they use subdomains and iFrames, which Google hates, but now they compete with their partners.\n\nYes.\n\nYou can opt into a yearly plan at a 2 month discount.\n\nThe Essentials plan is $849.50/year ($169 savings)\n\nThe Premium plan is $1195/year ($244 savings)\n\n*   **Absolutely**.

See what real estate agents and top marketers say about us.](https://showcaseidx.com/idx-reviews)**\n\n*   Buyers and sellers spent more than 29,400,000 minutes on our customer\u2019s websites last year.\u00a0**That\u2019s like watching Avengers Endgame over 161,000+ times.**\n*   Our customers see 83% additional traffic from Google (on average) and an increase in lead generation that gets better as they\u2019re able to focus on content and their business while we focus on providing your search and engagement tools.\n*   \u201cShowcase IDX retains 8.5x more clients than IDX Broker and 4x more clients than the typical iHomeFinder website\u201d.\u00a0[Learn more here.](https://www.themadeinamericamovement.com/idx-report-and-reviews/)\n\nSome MLS\u00ae systems offer a free or inexpensive search program but most agents quickly find ou these solutions are not built for modern marketing or lead capture.\u00a0**The MLS systems are great at delivering data but not making that data friendly to consumers.

Our maps are the fastest maps available, sharing the same platform as Facebook, The Weather Company, Adobe, Snap, and Mastercard.\n\nNo, absolutely not.\n\nWe take site speed very seriously (in fact, we rarely ever shut up about it) and we created this plugin with performance in mind.\n\nFeel confident knowing that we\u2019re built on the cloud platform that powers Google, Spotify, and Paypal, with 100k miles of fiber optic cable powering your IDX solution.\n\nWe also optimized all the code for the fastest possible loading times and can recommend a few great hosting companies if you need a recommendation that won\u2019t break the bank.\n\nNo, unfortunately not. It\u2019s almost impossible to rank a real estate site that is NOT built on WordPress.org (self-hosted or hosted through a Certified Partner). Watch\u00a0[this video to learn more](https://showcaseidx.com/common-real-estate-website-mistakes-how-to-fix-them/).\n\nThe solutions that currently work on Wix, Squarespace and WordPress.com are all iframe or subdomain based products. We hear that generating consistent new leads from those current add-on options can be hard.\n\nWe\u2019ve invested heavily in creating tools optimized for self-hosted WordPress sites. We hope to be able to partner with these additional partner with some of these platforms for a similar experience in the future. For now, we suggest choosing WordPress self-hosted.\n\nWebsites built on WordPress + Showcase IDX generate 83% additional traffic from Google. Start your trial to get the engine powering the most successful sites.\n\nIf you need to know more about the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com, this is a\u00a0[good overview](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-vs-wordpress-com/).\n\nDon\u2019t worry, it will be easy to get started, and we\u2019ll be here to help.\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Paperless MLS documentation.**\n\nYou will receive an email shortly with links to the e-documents for the MLS\u2019s you belong to. We will review your application and ensure compliance with the MLS. This typically can take anywhere from the same day to 5 business days depending on the MLS and how fast we get the signed documentation back from you. Please be sure to read and review your documentation (in some cases it has additional instructions which you must complete separately).\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 MLS Approval.**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve been approved by the MLS, we\u2019ll send you your personal IDX key and installation instructions. You will need your personal IDX key to make your Showcase IDX search work on your site.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Installation**\n\nWe\u2019ve made it as easy as possible to install the plugin on your site, so just follow the written-for-Realtors instructions and you should be good! If you have any issues, email us or call us at 1-800-478-0181.\n\nUnlike other plugins, you don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist to configure ours.\n\nYou can use real-time Showcase IDX lead data to capture and distribute contact information without having to manually add it, trigger marketing automations, and keep close track of their activity on your website.\n\nOur CRM Tools often work for individual agents and small team. However, we know that a CRM focused tool can benefit your business too. No worries. We have several that we love working with.\n\nKey integrations include LionDesk, and Follow Up Boss. We also work with 1000s of apps\u00a0[through Zapier](https://showcaseidx.com/ultimate-idx-zapier-integration-guide/)\u00a0to automate your work and find productivity superpowers.\n\nOur exclusive IDX engine contains more than 2,000,000 active real estate listings and 22,800,000 images. It is\u00a0continually updating new listings and images. Behind the scenes, it\u2019s working for you, to update 110,000 listings and 152,000 images per hour to send new MLS listings to the IDX search pages on your site for some MLSs in as little as 10-15 minutes, so you can be confident that your clients and website visitors will see the most up-to-date listings, images, and\u00a0information\n\nWe also offer you additional data that helps your clients find the home they\u2019re looking for, such as neighborhood & commute information, population information (total area population, age breakdowns, education levels, marital status, number of households with children, etc.), employment information, and more.\n\nYes and no. Fundamentally, Showcase IDX is a SaaS (software as a service) platform. We do require you to install a plugin to deliver the service to your website and your clients. This plugin allows us to connect our extensive platform with live data feeds and deliver the solution your business needs.\n\nYou don\u2019t want your website\u2019s search to look clunky and unprofessional.\u00a0**We seamlessly add the IDX search and engagement tools with your overall design like it was designed with search from the beginning.**\n\n**You can easily**\n\n*   Add the search anywhere on your site\n*   Choose from eight different map styles to personalize your site\n*   Add nine different lead capture widgets into your site\n*   Use CSS to customize the look and feel\n*   Choose to feature agent and/or office listings at the top of the search results\n*   Pick from 4 flexible display options for live IDX content, including grid view, list view, scrollable galleries, and auto-rotating slideshow galleries\n*   Pick the registration and content locks that work best for you business\n*   And more.\n\nNow,\u00a0**if you want add a new feature, suggest different UX/UI for the plugin, etc, we welcome your ideas as well.**\u00a0We have created some proprietary features such as the\u00a0[Friends & Family Search](https://showcaseidx.com/best-practices-for-agents-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-friends-family-search-on-your-website/)\u00a0from ideas within our team but many of our updates over the past year have come from the thousands of agents and brokers that use Showcase IDX to power their websites.\n\nOnce you become a Showcaser, you\u2019ll gain access to our private masterclass group and we\u2019ll share with your our ideas board where you can submit your ideas and see/vote on those ideas from other top performing agents.\n\nSimply put, a non-developer can deploy absolutely beautiful IDX search functionality on their site in less than an hour.\n\nI have used many IDX plugins for WordPress, and\u00a0**nothing comes even close when it comes to simplicity and beautiful appearance**.\n\n![Image 3: Anonymous on WordPress.org](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/tvo-no-photo.png)\n\nAnonymous on WordPress.org\n\n**WOULD YOU BET YOUR BUSINESS ON A IDX SOLUTION?**\n\nI have used a couple different idx solutions in the six years I have been a real estate agent.\u00a0**Showcase IDX has been easy to use and powerful enough to**\u00a0write neighborhood blog posts with vague boundaries to precise condo building blog posts.\n\n**Because Nashville Home Guru ranks so high in many different communities they are often surprised we are a team of less than 10 people (including agents)**.\n\n**We effectively compete everyday with Zillow, Trulia and Redfin ... Showcase Idx is critical to our success.**\u00a0No comparison. Our site stats for Nashville Home Guru are over 12K unique users per week.\u00a0**That is up significantly from a year ago when we were on Wolfnet Idx.**\u00a0The support team is very helpful. If you work your website as hard as we do ... it is important for support gets back to your in a timely manner.\n\n![Image 4: Wolfnet IDX review](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/Patrick-Higgins.jpg)\n\nPatrick HigginsTeam Leader At Nashville Home Guru\n\n**WHAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR ALL ALONG.**\n\n**This is my 3rd IDX, I have used both Diverse Solutions and IhomeFinder. Neither delivered what I wanted**: a simple but awesome user experience that looked great, was easy to use, SEO friendly and fast .\n\n**I found Showcase IDX after lots of research. It met my expectations, and then some.**\u00a0The\u00a0**quality of the search compares with the major real estate portal sites**. Since switching to Showcase,\u00a0**my bounce rate is down 20%, time spent on my site has doubled, and most importantly I am getting 4x more registrations on my site.**\u00a0Those results speak for themselves.\n\n**Clients and leads love the home search**. It is sleek, very user-friendly and has great mapping features. They can easily ask you as the agent a question from a listing.\u00a0**They can even add friends and family to their search**, which makes your site sticky**.**\u00a0Go for the premium content, users love to see the extra charts and data!\n\nShowcase IDX has the others beat. Competition for consumers' attention is intense.\u00a0**If you do not have the right IDX, people will immediately go to a different site. I find more web traffic returning to my site when I switched to Showcase IDX**. They also are always making improvements to make sure that they stay ahead of the curve.\n\nShowcase IDX has great support. I always use the chat feature online, and I am able to talk to a staff member every time that has answers to my questions within minutes.\n\n![Image 5: Will Rodgers](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/Will-Rodgers-Real-Estate-Marketing-Expert.jpeg)\n\nWill RodgersAgent & Web Marketing Expert\n\n**SHOWCASE IDX BRINGS THE LEADS!**\n\n**A large amount of business is generated through our website presence**, which has been a 15+ year ongoing project. Content creation is crucial to drive new organic traffic to the website, and delivering a valuable experience for our online visitors is paramount to me. At the end of the day though, if the IDX is not a rock-solid experience for our visitors, we won't get leads we need.\u00a0**I am very happy to say Showcase IDX delivers the leads! I am often told by prospects and clients that our website is their favorite in town.**\n\nThat makes me proud of the work that was put into it, and gives me the confidence that our search technology is exceeding our online visitors' expectations. Showcase IDX offers features not found in any other IDX. I always look forward to new product offerings, and can't wait to see what is next to allow us to shine online!\n\nI have reached out to support several times, and have always had a good experience with Support requests.\n\n![Image 6: idx seo and lead generation](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/Bill-McCue.jpeg)\n\nBill McCueBroker Associate\n\n**YOUR RETENTION RATE WILL BE MUCH HIGHER**\n\n**No subdomains or Iframes is probably my favorite feature, but at the end of the day it's about Results.**\u00a0Showcase IDX is the closest thing you're going to get to a custom coded IDX solution for your website. I like that\u00a0**it just flat out works for agents.**\n\nI think\u00a0**the biggest thing is how \"sticky\" their site becomes.**\u00a0Almost any site can generate leads but those same leads keep searching, with Showcase IDX,\u00a0**the retention rate is much higher.**\n\nWhat competition? Seriously, Idxbroker forces you to use subdomains and somewhat wacky javascript \"injections\" that break the continuity of the site. Zillow owned Dsidxpress was promising years (many years) ago but haven't innovated off their first iteration. ihomefinder is clunky and has poor conversion rates and styling. When I talk to clients about Showcase IDX it's either Showcase or another more custom solution that is 10X the cost!\n\nI've rarely had an issue where I needed support. That's a testament to how intuitive it is. The one time I needed support, I was answered promptly. Yes, I got treated as if I knew nothing and as a developer that annoys me, but the support team walked me through the ENTIRE process to get the problem solved. Thankfully my computer was on when they asked. \ud83d\ude09\n\n![Image 7: Joshua Jarvis](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/Joshua-Jarvis.png)\n\nJoshua JarvisOwner, 4rd Marketing\n\n**THE BEST ALL-AROUND IDX FOR REALTORS WANTING RESULTS**\n\n**We were previously using another IDX for our client sites. As a digital agency focused on measurable results, we were frustrated with the limitations we had.**\u00a0**We started researching alternatives and thank god we found Showcase IDX.**\n\nWe believe every Real Estate Agency has unique needs depending on their geographic market, agency size, competitors and budget. Therefore, we shy away from \"cookie-cutter\" sites and marketing plans and try to provide customizable and scalable solutions. Showcase IDX acts as the foundation of our sites and campaigns. The ease of \"Hotsheet\" shortcodes and \"Customized Searches\" allows us to quickly scale and build out landing pages integral to our marketing campaigns. The layout of the property detail page is designed in a way that is conversion-centric. The layout is user-friendly with well placed call-to-action buttons.\n\nAlthough we haven't evaluated every single IDX out there, we looked at a lot of options.\u00a0**Once we discovered Showcase IDX and communicated with their team, we knew we did not need to look further.**\u00a0It aligns with our ethos of providing a great user experience to the end-users.\n\nThe team at Showcase IDX have been very great. Fortunately, we have not needed much support. Their interface is\u00a0**very easy to implement and use.**\u00a0When we have needed help, they've been very quick to respond and answer our questions. Kurt has also been amazing with providing us with industry insights so that we can provide even more value to the Realtors we work with.\n\n![Image 8: Kevin Alvarez](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/Kevin-Alvarez-real-estate-marketing-websites.jpg)\n\nKevin AlvarezPresident, Blue Lynx Marketing\n\n**HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST, AND IT'S REALLY NOT EVEN CLOSE.**\n\nShowcase IDX has a number of dynamic features that help make it\u00a0**the superior WordPress IDX solution for our clients**. Included are a range of registration settings that help maximize lead generation, social login capability for frontend users, customizable SEO settings for listing detail pages, and\u00a0**a number of slick interactive tools that truly give home buyers a unique search experience**. In addition, Showcase IDX also includes most (if not all) of the MLS fields in any market, which is\u00a0**a major SEO boost for our clients as website competition gets stronger**.\n\nThe flexibility to connect to advanced, third-party CRMs is also a plus, but just having a Showcase IDX account will still provide you with basic lead management tools, like being able to see what listings users are viewing and setting leads up on saved searches just to name a couple.\n\nOver the years, the majority of my clients have been using expensive, all-in-one platforms, so we're only just getting started with Showcase IDX.\u00a0**We fully expect more of the agents and brokers we work with to love the value and flexibility Showcase IDX provides, especially as results our current users are seeing continue to improve.**\n\nCompared to any other WordPress IDX plugin, Showcase IDX is\u00a0**head and shoulders above the rest, and it's really not even close.**\n\nSupport has been amazing. Tiffany usually responds to any issues the same day I reach out.\n\n![Image 9: Joe Heath](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/Joe-Heath-Chicago-Real-Estate-Marketing.jpeg)\n\nJoe HeathMarketing Specialist, Real Estate Web Creation\n\n**AN EASY DECISION FOR REAL ESTATE AGENTS**\n\nShowcase IDX provides a user-friendly search &\u00a0**powerful lead generation tools that seamlessly integrate into your website**. For agents wanting a state-of-the-art real estate website that\u00a0**adds REAL VALUE for people in their community, Showcase IDX is an easy decision.**\n\nShowcase IDX's clean, modern, and user-friendly search is unmatched with other IDX plugins.\n\n**Nothing less than 5 STARS working with the support team**\u00a0at Showcase IDX.\n\n![Image 10: Robert Brock - Owner Web Designer](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/Robert-Brock-Owner-Web-Designer-Brock-Creative-Projects-scaled.jpg)\n\nRobert BrockOwner & Web Designer, Brock Creative Projects\n\n**SHOWCASE IDX ALL DAY EVERYDAY!**\n\nFrom a developer standpoint it's incredibly easy to setup, and\u00a0**we're wholly confident recommending it to our clients.**\u00a0It's great to offer a solution we know our clients will love. More importantly, we know the Showcase IDX team will continue improving their platform and staying on the bleeding edge. That is rare in an industry like real estate that's notoriously slow to embrace change.\n\nI think they're\u00a0**by far the best IDX solution out there. Forward thinking, always improving, with a clear focus on the interface - one of the major areas other providers fail**. Making sure the application is user-friendly is paramount to success in this space. They were also one of the first to fully embrace WordPress and make listings indexable.\u00a0**It feels like everyone else is still playing catch-up all these years later.**\n\nExcellent! The team has been very responsive and helpful the few times I've had to reach out.\n\n![Image 11: James Gillentine](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/28south-creative.png)\n\nJames GillentineShowcase IDX Certified Partner\n\n\u00a0**LOVE THE SIMPLICITY OF USE OF SHOWCASE IDX**\n\nI\u00a0**switched from IDX Broker**\u00a0because I liked the look of the results and\u00a0**wanted to move away from a**\u00a0sub domain. Creating hotsheets is quick and easy and adding to MY pages and post is as simple as a shortcode. No need to create separate pages and more SEO.\n\nEven though I do not force sign up and never have,\u00a0**I get more voluntary**\u00a0sign ups\u00a0**than I did with old provider.**\u00a0I think that speaks for itself.\n\nSupport is very good, they have only missed a couple of things and that's usually because they are\u00a0**constantly working on improving their product.**\u00a0If I don't get a response, all I do is call and they get right on it.\n\nPresentation, easy of use, they do a Facebook live session almost every week and some of the members are willing to pitch and and help as well. We have some geeks in the group.\n\n![Image 12: Corinne Guest](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/corinne-guest.jpeg)\n\nCorinne GuestBroker Owner, Barrington Realty\n\n\u00a0**SHOWCASE IDX - THE INDUSTRY STANDARD IDX SOLUTION**\n\nShowcase IDX is leading the way in the world of WordPress IDX solutions.

Tiffany in particular was a great partner in launching our site and we can't say enough about how valuable her assistance was.\n\nOur site is brand new, so we don't have a lot of client feedback to date.\n\n**Showcase IDX has a streamlined interface and easy to navigate features that don't clutter our website or lock us into particular themes.**\u00a0I especially appreciate the customizable buttons and text.\n\nI have been most\u00a0**impressed with the support team at Showcase IDX**. Without their help, and in particular, Tiffany Soucy, our website would not have launched on time.

As a web development agency owner, it is very important for me, and my clients to deliver an SEO friendly solution. It delivers everything you would need for an IDX solution and more!\n\nMy clients are realtors, they have a busy schedule. What's important to me is how their clients work with them through their websites. Showcase IDX helped me provide them with solutions that are simple and help\u00a0**provide them maximum conversion throughout their sales cycle.**\n\nBefore installing Showcase IDX the first time on a. clients website, I examined numerous solutions to be integrated with wordpress. I identified those solutions through the WordPress Repository, as well as examining HTML code on various websites for San Diego, CA realtors. And All I can tell you is that\u00a0**no solution even compares with what Showcase IDX offer. There is no way I would steer clients towards any other solution.**\n\nI collaborated with a couple support team agents, their reactivity through Live Chat, Email and Phone was first class. I'm very thankful for the information they were able to provide me at the time I needed it.\n\n![Image 16: Charles Oreve](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/Charles-Oreve.jpg)\n\nCharles OreveCEO, The X Concept\n\n**BEST WORDPRESS IDX, PERIOD.**\n\nI can\u2019t say enough good things about Showcase IDX (which I believe to be the best available WordPress IDX).\n\nSimple to use (i.e. low bounce rates and\u00a0**high user engagement**),\u00a0**great mapping with polygon search**, search by schools,\u00a0**fantastic mobile responsive functionality**, \u2018**login with facebook**\u2019,\u00a0**ultra-fast**, MLS updates every 10 minutes or less.. and they are\u00a0**always adding or updating functionalities**.\n\nBugs are relatively non-existent, and their\u00a0**support is absolute top tier**.

So when it came time to choose the IDX for my own real estate business website, it was a challenge. I selected Showcase IDX. Initially\u00a0**I chose Showcase IDX because it was responsive**, and offered both of my MLS feeds, along with quick integration.\n\n**I stayed with Showcase IDX because their service is great, and they listen!**\n\n**Showcase IDX is aware of what home buyers are looking for when they search online**, and they have integrated these features. I can quickly create neighborhood, school and other specialty pages to address the needs of my market. With so many IDX options, it can be overwhelming to make a selection. But\u00a0**choosing Showcase IDX was easy, and so is using it!**\n\n![Image 20: Marna Friedman](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/marna-friedman.png)\n\nMarna FriedmanReal Estate Agent\n\n**WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?**\n\n**Showcase has always been easy to use even for a beginner starting their own website.**\u00a0Building website pages and including specific hotsheets and shortcode widgets has never been easier. I use the shared search functionality to gather the list of homes and email or text the client a link of homes we will be previewing throughout the day.\u00a0**Showcase is so much cleaner than just using our own MLS systems.**\n\nClients always comment on the ease of use and the ability to quickly send a message, schedule an appointment or share a search. The photos and how they are displayed has also been a huge draw for potential clients, far superior than the competition.\u00a0**Since switching to Showcase registrations and customer interaction has increased tremendously.**\n\nPlus, the support team has been great. They will respond to issues small or large with no hesitation.\n\n![Image 21: real estate website review](https://showcaseidx.com/wp-content/uploads/Mike-Shrader.jpeg)\n\nMike ShraderRealtor - Partner at Southern Living Realty Partners\n\n**SIMPLE - POWERFUL - FLEXIBLE**\n\nWe were able to integrate Showcase with our WordPress site within a day.
