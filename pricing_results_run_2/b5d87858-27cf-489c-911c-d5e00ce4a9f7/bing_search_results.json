What does it cover?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes. Our implementation packages include getting a new account set up and launched, which is an expensive process, and the implementation packages help cover those expenses so that we can continue to keep your monthly costs low. The packages vary in cost depending on how much hands-on assistance your team will need getting up and running. They come in the following packages: Basic, Guided, Premium, and Custom.\n\nIs there a free trial?\n----------------------\n\nWe don\u2019t support a free trial of our paid plans, but we do offer a free version of our app: [SalesRabbit Lite](https://salesrabbit.com/lite). Lite doesn\u2019t include the full functionality or team management tools of our Team or Pro plans, but it\u2019s a great way for a single user to try out some of our core features and get a feel for how the app works.\n\nIs there a long-term contract?\n------------------------------\n\nYes, we do contracts from one to three years. We lock in pricing for the term of the agreement and offer both quarterly or annual billing options on most of our plans.\n\nHow does billing work?\n----------------------\n\nWe offer both quarterly and annual billing options on most of our plans. Each billing cycle has its own method for billing:\n\nANNUAL: All seats are paid upfront for one year. SalesRabbit bills for seats, not users, which means that a seat can be occupied by multiple users throughout the year, one user at a time. When a user is inactivated a seat is freed up. The next time a user is activated the freed-up seat will be used automatically and you will not be billed. You purchase a set number of seats which are equal to the maximum number of users that can be active at one time. Each login (canvasser, sales rep, manager, admin, owner, etc) will be counted as a user that occupies a seat. If any users are added beyond the seat limit, you will be billed a prorated amount for the new seats from the day the users are added until the end of the billing period. The number of seats invoiced each year will equal the minimum number of seats required or the number of active users on the account, whichever is higher. After payment has been made to the initial invoice, additional invoices will be automatically billed to the method of payment on file.\n\nQUARTERLY: All seats are paid upfront for 3 months at a time (one quarter). SalesRabbit bills for seats, not users, which means that a seat can be occupied by multiple users throughout the quarter, one user at a time. When a user is inactivated a seat is freed up. The next time a user is activated the freed-up seat will be used automatically and you will not be billed. You purchase a set number of seats which are equal to the maximum number of users that can be active at one time. Each login (canvasser, sales rep, manager, admin, owner, etc) will be counted as a user that occupies a seat. If any users are added beyond the seat limit, you will be billed a prorated amount for the new seats from the day the users are added until the end of the billing period. The number of seats invoiced every 3 months will equal the minimum number of seats required or the number of active users on the account, whichever is higher. After payment has been made to the initial invoice, additional invoices will be automatically billed to the method of payment on file.\n\nIs there a cancellation fee?\n----------------------------\n\nNo. We do not refund charges if you cancel in the middle of a billing cycle, so keep in mind that the cancelation process needs to be completed before the next billing cycle starts. If you sign back up after 30 days, there will be a new implementation fee.\n\nDo the \"additional capabilities\" cost extra?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nYes. These are in addition to the cost of the Team, Pro, or Enterprise plans. See our pricing above for more details or check out our [expanded pricing breakdown](https://salesrabbit.com/features). DataGrid AI is the only additional capability available on the Team plan.\n\nIs my data secure?\n------------------\n\nAbsolutely. We take data security very seriously and use industry-standard practices to protect you. Your data is never shared with any third party without your permission. We limit users\u2019 access to data and adhere to strict password standards. We also keep systems limited to their own network spaces and all data and network communications are encrypted.\n\nIf I cancel my subscription do I lose all of my data/leads?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, eventually. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to download and store your data before it becomes inaccessible.\n\nIs there a per contract processing fee?\n---------------------------------------\n\nNo. It\u2019s included in the Pro Plan and/or Digital Contracts pricing.\n\nOur Blog\n--------\n\n[![Image 13: field sales report](https://i0.wp.com/salesrabbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image1.png?resize=600%2C336&ssl=1)](https://salesrabbit.com/insights/salesrabbits-2025-field-sales-report-is-here/)\n\n[##### SalesRabbit\u2019s 2025 Field Sales Report Is Here We surveyed field sales professionals to create a data-driven roadmap for 2025.
