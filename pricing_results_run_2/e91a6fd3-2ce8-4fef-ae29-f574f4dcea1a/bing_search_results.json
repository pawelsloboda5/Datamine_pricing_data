With Thinkific, you can design an engaging, customized learning experience, manage students, track progress, and handle payments and selling, all in one place.\n\nThinkific was designed to get your online education business up and running without any advanced technical experience.\n\n**You don\u2019t need to be a developer to build your site and online courses.**\n\nWith AI tools like the Course Outline Generator, onboarding prompts, and step-by-step guidance, you can quickly create and launch your online learning business.\n\nYes. You can upgrade, downgrade or cancel your account at any time from within your site dashboard.\n\nDefinitely!\n\nWhile Thinkific does allow you to build an entire website, you can choose to use the platform for digital learning product creation alone.\n\nSo you can use Thinkific as the education portion to complement your existing website, whether it's custom built or created on a CMS like WordPress.\n\nEither way, you'll be able to create a fully integrated and seamless experience, from your domain and URLs to the visual branding. Your audience will see your courses, digital downloads, and other learning products alongside your main site as one holistic ecosystem.\n\nNo, you don\u2019t need a separate web host.

Customers processing payments on Thinkific Payments will not incur this fee.

courses, communities, memberships, digital downloads, coaching, webinars, and other digital products.\n\nYou can easily sell to both consumers and other businesses (B2B and B2C) using intuitive, easy-to-use tools and AI assistance. With Thinkific, you can design an engaging, customized learning experience, manage students, track progress, and handle payments and selling, all in one place.\n\nThinkific was designed to get your online education business up and running without any advanced technical experience.\n\n**You don\u2019t need to be a developer to build your site and online courses.**\n\nWith AI tools like the Course Outline Generator, onboarding prompts, and step-by-step guidance, you can quickly create and launch your online learning business.\n\nYes.
