FreeAgent exists online, which means that you can access your data from devices connected to the internet, like a laptop or mobile phone. Check out our [accounting glossary](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/accounting-software/) for more details.\n\nIs FreeAgent MTD-compatible?\n\nYes, FreeAgent is an HMRC-recognised product for submitting MTD-compatible VAT returns.\n\nCan I work with my accountant or bookkeeper in FreeAgent?\n\nYes, FreeAgent is built for small business owners and their accountants, and we\u2019ve made it easy for you to use the software to work with an accountant or bookkeeper if you choose to do so.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an accountant at the moment and you\u2019re interested in finding one, take a look at our [comprehensive directory of accredited FreeAgent accountants](https://www.freeagent.com/find-an-accountant/).\n\nHow secure will my data be in FreeAgent?\n\nFreeAgent is committed to protecting your personal and financial data using multiple layers of security. Your information is held securely in AWS data centres that meet the strictest [security standards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/security-and-compliance.html) and comply with [GDPR legislation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/all-aws-services-gdpr-ready/).\n\nAll data held and processed by FreeAgent is secured using industry-standard encryption technologies, both in transit and at rest. FreeAgent\u2019s application development process follows a secure development lifecycle and is protected at runtime to guard against potential malicious traffic and abuse.\n\n[Find out more about how FreeAgent keeps your data secure](https://www.freeagent.com/features/security/).\n\nDoes FreeAgent have a referral scheme?\n\nYes. If you have a direct subscription and you refer someone who goes on to subscribe to FreeAgent, both of you will receive a 10% discount on your FreeAgent subscriptions. If you successfully refer 10 people, your FreeAgent subscription will become free. Referral discounts last for as long as both you and your referee maintain your subscriptions.\n\nIf your FreeAgent account is provided by your bank, you can share your referral link, and any users you refer will earn 10% off their subscription if they subscribe to FreeAgent at the end of their free trial, but you won\u2019t receive any discounts on your subscription, as you already receive your FreeAgent account free of charge. If your FreeAgent account is provided by your accountant, you are not eligible for the referral scheme.\n\n[Find out more about the FreeAgent referral scheme](https://support.freeagent.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001218770).\n\nHow do I subscribe to an optional add-on?\n\nAfter you\u2019ve signed up for a FreeAgent account, you can turn add-ons on and off via the Connections and Add-ons page, which you can access through your account menu or Billing page.\n\nIf you don\u2019t currently pay for your FreeAgent account - i.e. if your account is provided by your bank or your accountant - then you\u2019ll first need to set up a suitable payment method to pay for the add-on subscription.\n\nHow does billing work for the Smart Capture Unlimited add-on?\n\nWithout subscribing to the Smart Capture Unlimited add-on, you\u2019ll be able to use Smart Capture 10 times per calendar month. When you subscribe to the add-on, you\u2019ll be billed \u00a35 (+VAT) each month, in a cycle that matches:\n\n*   your monthly billing cycle, if you pay for your FreeAgent account monthly\n*   the monthly equivalent of your annual billing cycle, if you pay for your FreeAgent account annually\n\nIf you don\u2019t currently pay for your FreeAgent account - i.e. if your account is provided by your bank or your accountant - then your Smart Capture Unlimited billing cycle will start on the day you subscribe. If you have already subscribed to another add-on service, such as Amazon, you will pay a pro rata payment for Smart Capture Unlimited until your next scheduled billing date. After that you will follow your original billing cycle for all subscriptions.\n\nIf you cancel Smart Capture Unlimited, you will continue to have access for the rest of the billing cycle, and then your Smart Capture usage limit will revert to the calendar month. For example, if you are billed on the 15th of each month and you cancel on the 10th, you will have access to Smart Capture Unlimited until the 14th; then from the 15th to the end of the calendar month, you would be able to use it the standard 10 times, and 10 times each calendar month thereafter.\n\n[Find out more in our Knowledge Base](https://support.freeagent.com/hc/en-gb/articles/13001479771922).\n\nHow does billing work for the Amazon add-on?\n\nWhen you subscribe to the add-on, you\u2019ll be billed \u00a36 (+VAT) each month, in a cycle that matches:\n\n*   your monthly billing cycle, if you pay for your FreeAgent account monthly\n*   the monthly equivalent of your annual billing cycle, if you pay for your FreeAgent account annually\n\nIf you don\u2019t currently pay for your FreeAgent account - i.e. if your account is provided by your bank or your accountant - then your Amazon billing cycle will start on the day you subscribe. If you have already subscribed to another add-on service, such as Smart Capture Unlimited, you will pay a pro rata payment for Amazon until your next scheduled billing date. After that you will follow your original billing cycle for all subscriptions.\n\nIf you cancel Amazon, your Amazon sales data will be imported until the end of the billing cycle and will then stop. Please note that any information already imported will be retained within your existing Amazon bank account in FreeAgent.\n\nIf you are billed on the 15th of each month and you cancel on the 10th, you will have access to Amazon until the 14th; then from the 15th your Amazon sales data will stop importing into FreeAgent.\n\n[Find out more in our Knowledge Base](https://support.freeagent.com/hc/en-gb/articles/14604015578258).\n\n*   [About us](https://www.freeagent.com/company/)\n*   [Careers](https://careers.freeagent.com/)\n*   [Contact us](https://www.freeagent.com/company/contact-us/)\n*   [Knowledge Base](https://support.freeagent.com/hc/en-gb)\n*   [Find an accountant](https://www.freeagent.com/find-an-accountant/)\n\n* * *\n\nProduct\n-------\n\n*   [Features](https://www.freeagent.com/features/accounting-software/)\n*   [Pricing](https://www.freeagent.com/pricing/)\n*   [Security](https://www.freeagent.com/features/security/)\n*   [App status](https://status.freeagent.com/)\n*   [The depot](https://www.freeagent.com/depot/)\n\nCompany\n-------\n\n*   [Blog](https://www.freeagent.com/blog/)\n*   [Product timeline](https://www.freeagent.com/timeline/)\n*   [Press room](https://www.freeagent.com/company/press-room/)\n*   [Partners](https://www.freeagent.com/partners/)\n*   [User research group](https://www.freeagent.com/user-research-group/)\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\n*   [Integrations](https://www.freeagent.com/integrations/)\n*   [FreeAgent API](https://dev.freeagent.com/)\n*   [Calculators](https://www.freeagent.com/apps/)\n*   [Accessibility](https://www.freeagent.com/company/accessibility/)\n*   [Referrals](https://www.freeagent.com/referrals/)\n\nLegal stuff\n-----------\n\n*   [Privacy notices](https://www.freeagent.com/privacy/)\n*   [Cookie Notice](https://www.freeagent.com/privacy/cookies-notice/)\n*   [Terms of service](https://www.freeagent.com/company/terms/)\n*   [Site terms](https://www.freeagent.com/company/terms/site-terms/)\n*   [GDPR](https://www.freeagent.com/privacy/freeagent-and-gdpr-compliance/)\n*   [Anti-tax evasion](https://www.freeagent.com/company/terms/anti-tax-evasion/)\n*   [Inclusion](https://www.freeagent.com/company/gender-pay-gap-report/)\n*   [Whistleblowing](https://www.freeagent.com/company/whistleblowing/)\n*   [Sustainability](https://www.freeagent.com/company/sustainability/)\n\n![Image 6: 2024 UK Customer Experience Awards, Silver Award Winner](https://freeagent-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_limit,w_400/dpr_auto,f_auto/website-images/awards/CXA24_winner_logo_silver.png)\n\n[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/freeagentapp/)[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/freeagentapp/)[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/freeagent/)[threads](https://www.threads.net/freeagentapp/)[x](https://www.x.com/freeagent/)\n\n [![Image 7: Cyber Essentials Plus Accreditation logo](https://freeagent-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_limit,h_96/dpr_auto,f_auto/website-images/shared/logo-cyber-essentials-plus.png)](https://www.freeagent.com/features/security/)[![Image 8: The FreeAgent website is part of the Plain English Campaign](https://freeagent-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_limit,h_96/dpr_auto,f_auto/website-images/logos/Internet_Crystal_Mark.png)](https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/)\n\nSelect location: \n\nFreeAgent is registered with the Financial Conduct Authority under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (register no. 799763) for the provision of account information services\n\nRegistered in sunny Scotland No. SC316774 - One Edinburgh Quay, 133 Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK EH3 9QG\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 by FreeAgent Central\n\nFreeAgent helps you manage your business finances with confidence.
