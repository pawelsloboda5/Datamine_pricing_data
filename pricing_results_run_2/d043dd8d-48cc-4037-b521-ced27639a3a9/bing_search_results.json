happy customers have to say!\n\n     ** EXCELLENT ** \n\n  \n\n Based on **43 reviews** \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Tobias B. \n\n \n\n2024-12-07\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**Easy to get started, but developers would likely find it laughable**\nOverall: Good start to solve repetitive data extraction for leadgen or from placed orders that need to be stored in databases. Pros: It's so easy to get started and handle e-mails in the same format again and again. Cons: In my opinion, the pricing does not reflect the value provided. It seems to capitalize on the limitations of those without coding skills, as extracting the required data from a mailbox is often achievable with a straightforward regex command. For comparison, Mail Parser by Zapier includes this functionality as a task, which typically costs around 2\u20133 cents per task, rather than the 10\u20135 cents charged here what on bulk can be 3x the costs when handling only a few hundred datasets per month.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Thomas P. \n\n \n\n2023-12-04\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**A functional email parser worth considering.**\nOverall: I use this to extract booking data from emails, enabling me to create user profiles and strea that data to other sevices. So far the experience ha been very good indeed. Pros: Mailparser.io passed the test for reliable email data extraction. The set up is easy, the webhook, api's and third party intergration makes this a very attractive platform. Cons: Overall, I can't fault it. The UI/UX is well built, with lots of great options and functionalities.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Zoe H. \n\n \n\n2023-09-11\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**Extract important customer data from emails**\nOverall: I eliminate hours of work with its good transfer of data extracted from multiple files directly to the excel sheet. Pros: Mailparser extracts the data quickly and data that has been important to find potential customers, the collected data is automatically stored in an excel sheet that saves me a lot of time working to organize this information. All emails are analyzed by extracting data from zip, pdf, DOCX files which in my opinion is a very good smart tool. Cons: It took me a while to learn how to use the platform correctly due to its long learning curve, on many occasions I had to contact support to clarify doubts.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Tom S. \n\n \n\n2023-08-13\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**Excellent for email to Airtable**\nPros: Fast, flawless, easy to review any faults. Cons: I can't come up with one. I sometimes don't look at it for weeks at a time. It just works...\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Verified Reviewer \n\n \n\n2023-05-20\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**Quickly became a critical tool for automating our processes**\nOverall: Very positive, liked the experience so much that will promote the solution to all that need it. Pros: Powerful features, capability to parse tables and attachments, including compressed files and PDFs, Cons: Nothing. Even the support was great and willing to assist when we had some difficulties parsing some more complex scenarios.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Brandon M. \n\n \n\n2023-02-13\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**Does Exactly What It Should, Highly Rated Exerpience**\nOverall: Fantastic, second to none in customer service, ease of use, implementation, data retention, data parsing, and data exporting. They are pure pleasure. Pros: It Just Works! When integrating multiple 3rd party tools, software, SAAS programs, and systems so they can all talk, you will ultimately run into hurdles. However, MailParser has never once failed to deliver. Once it was set up properly I have run MailParser for years without a single issue. One time I had to reach out to support because it had been over 3 years since I spoke to them or created a new needed integration, they answered quickly and showed me what I forgot. Never a single issue, always a pleasure, fast to reply, super friendly and the costs is minimal in comparison to other products, and you have the brand name king of the sphere when choosing MailParser! Cons: Some of the parsing fields can be confusing for the setup. However, customer service will share loom videos and walk you right through them, if I can see it once, I can replicate it without issue, and that was helpful.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n David S. \n\n \n\n2022-09-27\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**It got the job done**\nPros: Its very easy to set up al the rules you need to parse data efficiently. Cons: You are still limited by the rules available but customer support were great at advising how to use them to fit my need.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Bhushan F. \n\n \n\n2022-05-08\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**Nice to extract data when you want to extract less no of fields**\nOverall: Overall, a bit costly and difficult to setup for my usecase due to large no of fields to be parsed from emails and attachments. Their rule builder is powerful but for even simple things, it is not good to choose from so many options. Pros: 1. Nice UI 2. Powerful rules to extract data from emails and attachments 3. Data extraction and third party integration make it easier to send data to other softwares in your stack. Cons: 1. If you have upto 10 fields, it is easy to use. But as your fields grow, it becomes tedious to write rules for each field you want to parse. 2. Pricing is costly as compared to other softwares in the same market\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Verified Reviewer \n\n \n\n2022-01-30\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**MailParser Review**\nOverall: Outstanding. Once you learn how to use it, you can save thousands of dollars and hours per week. Pros: The utility of this is great. So many use cases. Not only can you parse email bodies, but also email attachments. Cons: It can be a little tricky at first. Once you get your first parsing rule and integration under your belt, this gets very straightforward.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Nikki G. \n\n \n\n2021-08-22\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**Intuitive, impressive, user-friendly**\nOverall: I personally sought out a site to leave mailparser a review because it is really an all around fantastic. incredibly useful product: great for beginners, generous free features, and will most definitely save time, propel progress, and increase productivity. Pros: I've sought far and wide for a program to parse the body text of my booking emails to auto-generate contacts/ contact data. I have Power Automate, but it is nowhere near as user-friendly as mailparser. I was able to fully customize and auto-export the specific info I needed in less than an hour (this includes set-up, briefing and overview of the system, connecting multiple apps, parsing and revising 20+ data keys, and then editing a bit more to narrow down text fields to my liking) After the first integration, the rest were a breeze! In fact, mailparser actually made automate easier for me to use! I am definitely considering an upgrade to a paid subscription (but would like to see more integrations with Google Apps for max ROI). Cons: As mentioned, would prefer more integrations with Google Apps, and perhaps one slightly lower price tier for paid subscriptions.              \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\nWhich Mailparser plan is right for me?\n\nThe best plan will be the one that matches your monthly or annual email volume.
