When it comes to something as private and confidential as your financial data, we want the reins in your hand. We only want to make money from you paying us money, with you fully knowing and understanding what\u2019s going on.\n\nYou pay us the monthly or annual subscription price, and there you have it. That\u2019s it. Transaction complete. That\u2019s how we make our money.\n\n[**Read more about why we don\u2019t (and won\u2019t) sell your data.**](https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/ynab-privacy)\n\nHow much can I expect to save with YNAB?\n\nOn average, new YNABers save $600 in their first two months with YNAB. Oh, and more than $6,000 after one year. Also, they enjoy more control and less stress. In terms of an investment, that\u2019s a serious return.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to take our word for it. [**Let the numbers speak for themselves.**](https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/is-ynab-worth-it-12-customers-weigh-in)\n\nDo you really give college students YNAB for free?\n\nWe offer all college students a free 365-day trial. If you\u2019re interested, check out [**our College Program**](https://www.youneedabudget.com/college) to submit proof of enrollment\u2014think student ID card, transcript or tuition statement (but anything that shows you are currently enrolled and includes your name, your school, and the date will do). We can\u2019t wait to help you manage your money!\n\nCan I offer YNAB as a benefit to my employees?\n\nMost certainly! [Financial Wellness by YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/wellness) is a benefits program that combines YNAB app access with our award-winning support and financial education. We help employees build mindful spending habits so they can be fully present to collaborate, create, and connect when they're at work.\n\nYou can learn more, start your team's self-service subscription, or contact our Enterprise sales team at [ynab.com/wellness](https://ynab.com/wellness).\n\nDo you have a YNAB family plan?\n\nYes, it's all included in your YNAB subscription! [You can share your YNAB with partners, families, and other close-knit groups of up to six people](https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/introducing-ynab-together-for-your-shared-financial-journey)\u2014all for the price of a single subscription.\n\nDoes bank import work for non-US/Canadian banks?\n\nDirect import currently supports select US, Canadian, UK, and EU Banks. If you don\u2019t live in any of those regions, [**File-Based Import**](https://support.ynab.com/en_us/file-based-import-a-guide-Bkj4Sszyo) works like a charm. (It\u2019s seriously slick, you should try it.)\n\nIs the exchange rate taken into account with pricing?\n\nYNAB is priced in US dollars. Exchange rates are not reflected in the price.\n\nIs a credit card required to sign up?\n\nNope, no credit card needed when you sign up directly through us! Sign up and try YNAB free for 34 days without ever entering your credit card by using the Free Trial button above. At the end of your free trial, you can pick one of the plans (monthly or yearly) and enter your payment method.  \n  \nKeep in mind that third-party app stores may require credit card information when signing up for a trial.\n\nDoes YNAB support multiple currencies?\n\nYou can select the currency you want to use in YNAB, but you can\u2019t use multiple currencies together in a single spending plan.\n\nI have YNAB 4, do I need to buy it again?\n\nIf you\u2019d like to use the new YNAB, you will need to create a new account, sign-up for a free, 34-day trial, and then (hopefully!) purchase a subscription. If you\u2019d like to continue using YNAB 4, check out [**this page**](https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/ynab-4-support-will-end-october-2019) for all of the details on compatibility and support.\n\nIf I upgrade from YNAB 4, is there a discount for existing users?\n\nYes!
