limits?\n\nWhen a site reaches its monthly usage limits, it enters a suspended state until the first of the next month. We\u2019ll notify you by email as you approach your limits at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% of usage. Please note that if one site exceeds its limits, all sites on your Free account will be suspended.\n\nYou can re-enable your sites at any time by upgrading your plan. Your sites will automatically resume normal operation after upgrading.\n\nHow does team membership affect billing?\n\nThe team Owner is billed based on the number of active members, your team plan\u2019s member limit, and your team\u2019s usage. Teams will not be charged for Reviewers.\n\nNetlify will send a notification email to Team Owners when teams approach the member limit for their current team plan.\n\nYour team will be charged for Git Contributors if you are on a Netlify Pro or Netlify Enterprise plan.\n\nVisit our documentation on [deploy permissions](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/#deploy-permissions) for more information.\n\nHow does billing work for metered features and extra usage packages?\n\nMetered features are priced based on your usage. When a site\u2019s usage of a metered feature reaches the limit of the current level, it triggers an automatic upgrade to the next level, or purchase of an extra usage package.\n\nWith metered features, some usage thresholds trigger an automatic upgrade to the next level, and others trigger purchase of an extra usage package.\n\nExtra usage packages increase your allowance for all metered features in the package \u2014 including ones that are still below their limit.\n\nFor more information on usage, visit our [Billing docs](https://docs.netlify.com/accounts-and-billing/billing/).\n\nCan I pay for my Pro plan annually?\n\nNo, only Netlify Enterprise plans come with an annual payment option.\n\nCan I pay with PayPal, wire transfer, crypto, or any method other than credit card?\n\nNetlify only accepts credit cards unless you have a Netlify Enterprise plan, in which case we do accept payment via ACH or wire transfer.\n\nCan I set a limit of metered features and have it shut off when the limit is reached?\n\nWhile you can\u2019t set custom usage caps, Free plan sites automatically pause if they exceed monthly limits, ensuring you never receive unexpected charges. We\u2019ll send email notifications at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% of your usage to help you track consumption.\n\nIf I choose to downgrade from one Netlify plan to another, how and when does the downgrade go into effect?\n\nWhen making a downgrade from one Netlify plan to another, the downgrade goes into effect immediately and will be reflected in your next billing cycle.\n\nFind the right Netlify platform plan to fit your business needs. Our plans include value for developers and enterprise teams alike.",
