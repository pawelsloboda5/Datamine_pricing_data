Ignite can be built quickly, but IDX approval typically takes 1-2 weeks, which is why we estimate 3 weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to note that the build time starts once the Onboarding Forms are completed. To keep your project on schedule, please complete all the onboarding forms as soon as possible after signup. This ensures we can begin work immediately and deliver your website on time.\n\nHow can I see website examples?\n\nYou can check out [Our Portfolio](https://agentfire.com/best-real-estate-agent-websites/) page to view examples. You can also contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@agentfire.com) to request examples from specific MLSs and markets.\n\nIs it possible to login and see the dashboard?\n\nYes, but you\u2019ll need to complete a [demo](https://agentfire.com/schedule-a-demo/) with our sales team first. After the demo, your salesperson can give you temporary access to a dashboard to explore. We believe in providing an overview before accessing the dashboard to ensure you get the most out of our platform. When your site goes live, you\u2019ll also receive a 1-hour recorded training session with our success team to review the basics and tailor the training to your goals.\n\nYou can also check out our [Pitch Deck](https://agentfire.com/pitch-deck/) for an overview of everything you\u2019ll find in our dashboard, including the Spark Editor, Lead Manager, AI Tools, and more.\n\nDo I need to sign a long-term contract?\n\nNo! We don\u2019t do long-term contracts. Our clients stay with AgentFire year after year because they love the product and the continuous improvements we make.\n\nWhat is covered in the base $149\\* monthly fee?\n\nThe base monthly fee includes IDX integration, access to support, site hosting fees, feature upgrades, and more. Your site is hosted on a professional-grade server with CDN deployment. You\u2019ll receive automatic updates to our features, ensuring your site remains optimized and up-to-date. Additionally, your site is backed up daily for peace of mind, and demographic & school data through Home Junction (unlimited) is regularly updated.\n\n\\*IDX fees do not include MLS pass-through fees\n\nWhen do my monthly fees start?\n\nThe start date for your monthly fees depends on the design package you choose. For the Ignite package, fees begin 3 weeks after purchase. For the Semi-Custom package, fees start at 4 weeks, and for the Custom package, fees commence at 6 weeks. These timelines align with the average time it takes to launch each package.\n\nWe initiate fees at these points to keep projects on schedule and ensure clients stay engaged throughout the design process. Consistent communication and timely feedback are crucial for delivering your website on time and maintaining a smooth workflow for all our clients. Starting fees at these intervals helps us manage our extensive client base efficiently and avoid delays in our project pipeline.\n\nCan I upgrade my design package?\n\nYes, you can upgrade your design package. If work has not yet begun, you can simply pay the difference between your current package and the upgraded package.\n\nIf you want to upgrade after work has started, the policy varies by package. For the Ignite package, you would need to pay the full price of the new package. For Semi-Custom packages upgrading to Custom, you would only need to pay the difference in cost.\n\nDoes AgentFire come with a CRM?\n\nAgentFire does not include a full-featured CRM. Instead, we offer our \u2018Lead Manager,\u2019 designed to collect essential lead information such as time last active, properties viewed, and the ability to view, edit, and create new saved searches. This information is seamlessly passed to leading third-party CRMs. Our philosophy is to focus obsessively on creating the best website experience, and then seamlessly integrate with top tools for CRM, PPC, and other needs. While AgentFire can [integrate with any third-party CRM](https://agentfire.com/integrations/) thanks to a top-notch [Zapier app](https://zapier.com/apps/agentfire/integrations), our tightest integrations are with FollowUpBoss and CRMGrow.\n\nDo I own the website?\n\nYou own all of the unique content you add to your AgentFire website. However, the design and proprietary technology used by AgentFire are non-transferable. If you choose to discontinue AgentFire, your unique content will need to be manually migrated, as the design and features are built on our proprietary system and cannot be exported.\n\nHow much support do I get?\n\nWe offer unlimited email/live chat support to help you with whatever you need. You can reach us using two methods:\n\n1.  By emailing [support@agentfire.com](mailto:support@agentfire.com)\n2.  By clicking on the Live Help button inside your dashboard.\n\nResponse times on average are same day when sent between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday.\n\nAdditionally, when your site launches, you\u2019ll receive a 1-hour success call to ensure everything is set up correctly, and additional training sessions can be setup as needed.\n\nFor clients seeking more in-depth assistance, our \u2018[Virtual Concierge](https://agentfire.com/marketplace/virtual-cocncierge/)\u2018 addon provides a premium support experience, akin to having a virtual assistant.\n\nCan I add my own plugins?\n\nNo, you cannot add your own plugins. While AgentFire was originally WordPress-based, we have since transitioned to a 100% proprietary system. Our platform is designed to offer all the tools and features you need without the need for external plugins.\n\nHow does AgentFire handle website security?\n\nAt AgentFire, we take your site\u2019s security very seriously and employ a multi-layered approach to ensure its safety:\n\n1.  **Regular Backups:** We maintain regular backups of all sites and related data, stored on our network for quick recovery in case of any issues.\n    \n2.  **Firewall Protection:** We use Cloudflare to ensure all traffic is filtered and monitored to block any suspicious activity.\n    \n3.  **Access Control:** We have fine-grained access control in our organization, meaning only authorized personnel, such as our infrastructure department, can access your files. This group does not include developers, ensuring a high level of security.\n    \n4.  **Code Review:** All internally developed code for our plugins and frameworks is reviewed by at least one or two other developers before deployment on live sites.\n    \n5.  **Security Scans:** We regularly perform security scans to identify and patch known vulnerabilities (CVEs), ensuring they cannot be used against our system.\n    \n\nIn summary, we have physical and digital barriers in place to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that our systems remain secure. Your site\u2019s security is our top priority, and we continually work to maintain and improve our protective measures.\n\nWill my website be ADA compliant?\n\nAt AgentFire, we optimize our core templates to meet ADA compliance standards, ensuring all websites are compliant out of the box. During the initial development phase, our designers will suggest best practices and alert you to any non-compliant requests. However, because clients control their design and content, it is ultimately your responsibility to maintain ADA compliance. For an extra layer of security, consider our [ADA Protect](https://agentfire.com/marketplace/ada-protect/) addon!\n\n![Image 8: social-bedges](blob:http://localhost/48f76619a5bd00ce057f2024dcf38bc1)\n\n![Image 9: White-Stars](blob:http://localhost/48f76619a5bd00ce057f2024dcf38bc1)\n\nJoin the #1 rated real estate platform\n--------------------------------------\n\nThousands of agents and teams choose AgentFire.

These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to all people: blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.\n\nThis website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website\u2019s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.\n\nAdditionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website\u2019s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.\n\nIf you\u2019ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we\u2019ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website\u2019s operators by using the following email\n\n### Screen-reader and keyboard navigation\n\nOur website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website\u2019s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here\u2019s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements, alongside console screenshots of code examples:\n\n1.  **Screen-reader optimization:** we run a background process that learns the website\u2019s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all the website\u2019s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.\n    \n    These adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA.\n    \n2.  **Keyboard navigation optimization:** The background process also adjusts the website\u2019s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside it.\n    \n    Users can also use shortcuts such as \u201cM\u201d (menus), \u201cH\u201d (headings), \u201cF\u201d (forms), \u201cB\u201d (buttons), and \u201cG\u201d (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n    \n\n### Disability profiles supported in our website\n\n*   **Epilepsy Safe Mode:** this profile enables people with epilepsy to use the website safely by eliminating the risk of seizures that result from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.\n*   **Visually Impaired Mode:** this mode adjusts the website for the convenience of users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataract, Glaucoma, and others.\n*   **Cognitive Disability Mode:** this mode provides different assistive options to help users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, to focus on the essential elements of the website more easily.\n*   **ADHD Friendly Mode:** this mode helps users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders to read, browse, and focus on the main website elements more easily while significantly reducing distractions.\n*   **Blindness Mode:** this mode configures the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. A screen-reader is software for blind users that is installed on a computer and smartphone, and websites must be compatible with it.\n*   **Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired):** this profile enables motor-impaired persons to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Users can also use shortcuts such as \u201cM\u201d (menus), \u201cH\u201d (headings), \u201cF\u201d (forms), \u201cB\u201d (buttons), and \u201cG\u201d (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n\n### Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments\n\n1.  **Font adjustments \u2013** users, can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more.\n2.  **Color adjustments \u2013** users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds, with over seven different coloring options.\n3.  **Animations \u2013** person with epilepsy can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions.\n4.  **Content highlighting \u2013** users can choose to emphasize important elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only.\n5.  **Audio muting \u2013** users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly.\n6.  **Cognitive disorders \u2013** we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others.\n7.  **Additional functions \u2013** we provide users the option to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions.\n\n### Browser and assistive technology compatibility\n\nWe aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers).\n\n### Notes, comments, and feedback\n\nDespite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs. There may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements.
