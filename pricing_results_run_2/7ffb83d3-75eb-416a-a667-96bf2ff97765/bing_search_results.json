With a full suite of CRM, sales enablement, marketing automation, and help desk/customer support capabilities, it\u2019s all you need to manage the entire customer lifecycle. Most of our competitors offer one or two of these functions as separate products, leaving you with the headache of integrating them and increasing the overall price point.\n\nCan I change plans or cancel my subscription at any time?\n\nYou can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time. Plus, you can simply do this yourself from Agile CRM\u2019s online dashboard.\n\nHow secure is my data with Agile CRM?\n\nAgile CRM uses a highly secure namespace on Google cloud, which essentially means your data is stored in a single database rather than being stored in a massive, shared database. This allows your data to remain private and separate from that of other customers. You will not share a database with other customers, as is often the case with other CRM providers.\n\nWhat is the uptime guarantee?\n\nUptime refers to the amount of time a system will be available to you online\u2014in other words, how likely is glitch or bug to make the system temporarily unavailable. Agile CRM offers a 99.5% uptime guarantee on all paid plans, meaning the system will be available 99.5% of the time, guaranteed. We are hosted on Google and Amazon cloud for scale, so you\u2019ll see virtually no downtime.\n\nHow can I add more emails to my account?\n\nYou can add more emails to your Agile CRM account by buying an email add-on package. The emails from the add-on package last for one month from the time of your purchase.\n\nWho is considered a \"user\" in Agile CRM?\n\nA user is any staff member who has their own unique login to Agile CRM. Each user\u2019s actions in the system are tracked back to that specific person, which aids in increasing transparency and efficiency.\n\nDo you offer special discounts for nonprofit organizations?\n\nNonprofit organizations with limited resources can use our free plan. In addition, we have intentionally kept our prices as some of the absolute lowest in the industry, for the features offered, so that both nonprofit organizations and for-profit companies can benefit from them.\n\nWhy do over 15,000 businesses rely on Agile CRM?\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLet them tell you.\n------------------\n\n![Image 11: Nicholas J Down](https://www.agilecrm.com/img/crm/nicholas.png)\n\n**Nicholas J Down**  \nMarch 28th, 2018\n\nHave just installed and setup Agile CRM and am blown away by the level of service. They just step up and help with everything and anything. Fantastic first impressions indeed.\n\n![Image 12: Joe Ward](https://www.agilecrm.com/img/crm/joeward.png)\n\n**Joe Ward**  \nApril 6th, 2018\n\nSuch a great program. I use it for my personal business. Imagine if you take everything you loved from all of your other CRM's and combined it into one. This would be the best way to describe this amazing tool.\n\n![Image 13: Brian Melendez](https://www.agilecrm.com/img/crm/brianm.png)\n\n**Brian Melendez**  \nJune 1st, 2018\n\nOur business has just started using this tool and we have been very pleased with the support and capabilities of the product.
