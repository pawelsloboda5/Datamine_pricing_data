This means that they will be automatically extended on their end date. If you want to prevent auto-renewal, you need to disable it from the billing section of your account.\n\n##### What happens if the auto-renewal payment is not successful?\n\nIf the payment is unsuccessful, you will receive an email and an onscreen notification within Inoreader. The payment attempt from your credit card/PayPal account will be retried multiple times throughout the following week. During this period, your access will be unaffected, and you will be able to use premium features.\n\n##### What happens when I cancel my Inoreader Pro subscription?\n\nIf you cancel your Pro subscription, your account will be downgraded, and limitations will apply. However, all premium features exceeding the limits will remain but will be deactivated. When you upgrade your account, your Pro features will be enabled again and continue working as before.\n\n##### How do I stop a subscription purchased by App Store or Google Play?\n\nYou can do that by accessing _**Subscriptions**_ in your Apple or Google account. Your Inoreader subscription should be listed there. You can also do that from the Inoreader app by going to _**Settings \\> Pro features \\> Manage subscription**._\n\n##### Can I increase the limit on a single feature?\n\nYou can do that by going to _**Preferences \\> Billing and usage \\> Usage \\> Increase limits**_. You can then select the feature and limits you would like to increase.\n\n##### Can I have an invoice for my payment?\n\nYes, you can add your business info at the checkout by choosing the _**Are you a business**_ option and entering your business details. After this, you\u2019ll start automatically receiving invoices for your payments. If entering your business info isn\u2019t convenient, or the payment has already been processed, you can contact us no later than five business days and ask for an invoice.\n\n##### What happens when I decide to upgrade my existing subscription?\n\nWith the new limits, your current subscription will be prorated, meaning you will only pay the price difference between the two plans for the prepaid period.\n\n##### Why do I see a difference in the official pricing?\n\nIf you purchase a subscription plan from Europe, VAT will be applied. The VAT rate depends on your country of residence and will be added to the Inoreader price. If you are VAT registered, you must add your company data and will not be charged.\n\n##### Can I get a refund?\n\nYes. You can get a refund on an annual payment within seven days of your purchase. No questions, no explanations. Your payment method will be credited with the full amount of your purchase.\n\n##### Can I use my subscription on multiple platforms?\n\nIf you have an active subscription, you can use Inoreader in your browser and on our iOS and Android apps.\n\nChoose the Inoreader plan that best fits your needs.
