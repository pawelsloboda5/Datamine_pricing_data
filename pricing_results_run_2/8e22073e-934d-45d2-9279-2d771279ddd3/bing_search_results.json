I can not see myself running my photo booth business without them. The only thing that is better then their tool is their service ... I would highly recommend Check Cherry as my tool of choice.\" \n \n~ Dan Gono, GoBooth - Photo Booth Rental \n     \n  \n \n \n \nWhat is counted as an \"Upcoming Booking\"? \nAn \"Upcoming Booking\" is a confirmed/signed booking on your calendar with a date in the future. After you provided your services for the booking, it will be in the past and not counted against your total. \nMost customers fall under our Basic Plan. As your business grows, it's easy to move plans. Charges are automatically prorated, we'll give you plenty of warning. We even add in a grace buffer of a few events, so you don't miss a sale.    \n \n \n \nHow long does it take to setup? \nWe've seen people up and running in less than an hour. Naturally, it depends on the size and complexity of your business. If you already productized your services (offer packages and add-ons), you'll be up in the running in a jiffy. If you need help at any point, chat with us, and we'll point you in the right direction.   \n \n \nDo you offer a free trial? \nYes. We currently offer a 14-day free trial. Just select a plan, complete registrations and you'll have full access to all the features for the plan you select. If you need more time, just let us know and we can extend the trial.    \n \n \n \nCan I cancel anytime? \nAbsolutely. Cancel at any time and Check Cherry will no longer bill you. We're serious: if you're not happy with the service, we don't want your money. Our goal is to deliver value to your business.   \n \n \nCan I upgrade at anytime? \nAbsolutely. As your business grows, you may need to change plans. At any point, you can upgrade your plan, and we'll prorate the balance due based on any portion of the current plan you have not used. You can also start with a monthly plan and move to an annual plan at any time.     \n \n \n \nHow does the money back guarantee work? \nWithin the first 60 days of starting your Free Trial, you can request a refund and we'll give you your money back regardless of the reason.   \n \n \nIs it a month to month contract? \nWe offer both monthly and annual plans. You can choose a monthly plan, and you'll be billed once per month. If you want a yearly plan, you'll be charged once per year and save some money.       \n \n \n \n \n       \n\"Not only is Check Cherry an essential business tool, the user support is unparalleled.\"   \n \n\n \n \n \nName *  \n \n \nTry Check Cherry free for 14 days, no credit card required.  \n  \n Try Check Cherry free for 14 days, no credit card required.            \n \n \n \n \n \nCompany \n \nAbout \nGoogle Reviews \nFAQ \nPrivacy & Terms \nDeveloper API \nJobs   \n \nFor Boothers \n \nFree Photo Booth Templates \nPhoto Booth Business Checklist \nPhoto Booth Business Plan  \nFor Mobile Bartenders \n \nMobile Bartending Pricing Guide \nMobile Bar Business Plan  \nFor Photographers \n \nMini Sessions Packages & Pricing \nMini Session Ideas   \n \nResources \n \nArticles \nFeature Videos \nCheck Cherry Works With  \nWebinars \nSchedule A Demo \nVs Honeybook   \n \nPopular Industries \n \nParty Rental Software For Small Business \nPhoto Booth Booking Software \nMC/DJ Booking Software \nVenue Booking Software \nMobile Bartending Booking Software \nGame Truck Booking Software \nCasino Party Booking Software \nParty Booking Software \nPhotographer Booking Website \nMini Session Scheduler \nMobile Notary Scheduling Software    \n    \n  \u00a9 2016-2025 \n \n  \n Booking and Client Management Software \n  hello@checkcherry.com    \n \nAll product and company names are trademarks\u2122 or registered\u00ae trademarks of their respective holders.
