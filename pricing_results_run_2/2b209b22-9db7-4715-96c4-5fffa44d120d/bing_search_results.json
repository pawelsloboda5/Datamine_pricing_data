Everything is in the cloud, so there are no downloads or installs, for you or your users. On-premises or hybrid storage solutions are available with our Enterprise plans.\n\n#### [How does ShareFile secure my files?](https://www.sharefile.com/pricing#1067240601-389406488-2)\n\nShareFile safeguards your documents with industry-accepted encryption protocols and algorithms in transit and at rest. Your files are encrypted with up to 256-bit encryption using industry-standard encryption protocols.\n\n#### [What\u2019s the difference between a client user and an employee user?](https://www.sharefile.com/pricing#1067240601-389406488-3)\n\nThink of employee users as internal users who work for your company and client users as external users. Employee users manage the account and can request and send files to client users. Client users are able to upload and download files, along with a few others capabilities. All ShareFile plans have unlimited client users.\n\n#### [How does ShareFile streamline work with email, search and sync?](https://www.sharefile.com/pricing#1067240601-389406488-4)\n\nShareFile for Mac or Windows allows users to access files directly through a mapped drive, providing a native file storage experience. ShareFile for Outlook and Google Workspace allows users to insert links to files, upload and send new files, and request files directly from Microsoft Outlook or Gmail email messages.\n\n#### [How does encrypted email work?](https://www.sharefile.com/pricing#1067240601-389406488-5)\n\nShareFile allows you to encrypt not just email attachments, but also the body of your message to your recipient. It\u2019s a simpler way to support compliance and add security. And even better: Recipients don\u2019t need to be ShareFile customers or have a username and password to view or respond to an encrypted email.\n\n#### [Can I send files for e-signature from ShareFile?](https://www.sharefile.com/pricing#1067240601-389406488-6)\n\nThe ShareFile Premium plans includes integrated electronic signature at no extra cost. With integrated e-signature, you can send files stored in your ShareFile account quickly for secure, legally binding e-signatures. Signed documents are saved automatically back to ShareFile, making the process seamless.\n\n      ![Image 12](https://sharefile.widen.net/content/fa538f29-5ab2-4463-b6a5-a02516d878e1/web/Website_3D_Stills_ShareFile_PROD_Stills_03_StructuredTowers_V005_JS__CC_V002_RS.jpg?crop=yes&k=c&w=480&h=480&itok=GAeU9WxB)\n\n#### Got questions?\n\nLet's talk about how we can create a solution that works for you.\n\n[#### We\u2019ve got answers Contact Sales](https://www.sharefile.com/contact-us)\n\n*   Product Features\n    *   [Client portal](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/client-portal)\n    *   [Integrated e-signature](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/integrated-e-signature)\n    *   [Regulatory compliance support](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/regulatory-compliance-support)\n    *   [Workflow automation](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/custom-workflow-automation)\n    *   [Rapid client onboarding](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/rapid-client-onboarding)\n    *   [Dedicated collaboration spaces](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/dedicated-collaboration-spaces)\n    *   [Template Library](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/template-library)\n\n*   Resources\n    *   [Help Center](https://support.sharefile.com/s/)\n    *   [Resource Center](https://www.sharefile.com/resource-center)\n    *   [Blog](https://www.sharefile.com/blogs)\n    *   [Events & Webinars](https://www.sharefile.com/events-webinars)\n    *   [Customer Stories](https://www.sharefile.com/customer-stories)\n    *   [FAQs](https://www.sharefile.com/faq)\n    *   [Apps & Integrations](https://www.sharefile.com/apps-integrations)\n    *   [Developers](https://api.sharefile.com/)\n    *   [Contact Us](https://www.sharefile.com/contact-us)\n\n*   Solutions\n    *   [Accounting](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/accounting)\n    *   [Finance](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/finance)\n    *   [Insurance](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/insurance)\n    *   [Healthcare](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/healthcare)\n    *   [Legal](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/legal)\n    *   [Virtual Data Room](https://www.sharefile.com/plans/sharefile-virtual-data-room)\n\nFollow Us\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sharefile)\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/Sharefile)\n\n[X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/Sharefile)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Sharefile)\n\n[](https://www.progress.com/ \"Progress-logo\")ShareFile is part of the Progress product portfolio.

Everything is in the cloud, so there are no downloads or installs, for you or your users. On-premises or hybrid storage solutions are available with our Enterprise plans.\n\n#### [How does ShareFile secure my files?](https://www.sharefile.com/plans-pricing#1067240601-389406488-2)\n\nShareFile safeguards your documents with industry-accepted encryption protocols and algorithms in transit and at rest. Your files are encrypted with up to 256-bit encryption using industry-standard encryption protocols.\n\n#### [What\u2019s the difference between a client user and an employee user?](https://www.sharefile.com/plans-pricing#1067240601-389406488-3)\n\nThink of employee users as internal users who work for your company and client users as external users. Employee users manage the account and can request and send files to client users. Client users are able to upload and download files, along with a few others capabilities. All ShareFile plans have unlimited client users.\n\n#### [How does ShareFile streamline work with email, search and sync?](https://www.sharefile.com/plans-pricing#1067240601-389406488-4)\n\nShareFile for Mac or Windows allows users to access files directly through a mapped drive, providing a native file storage experience. ShareFile for Outlook and Google Workspace allows users to insert links to files, upload and send new files, and request files directly from Microsoft Outlook or Gmail email messages.\n\n#### [How does encrypted email work?](https://www.sharefile.com/plans-pricing#1067240601-389406488-5)\n\nShareFile allows you to encrypt not just email attachments, but also the body of your message to your recipient. It\u2019s a simpler way to support compliance and add security. And even better: Recipients don\u2019t need to be ShareFile customers or have a username and password to view or respond to an encrypted email.\n\n#### [Can I send files for e-signature from ShareFile?](https://www.sharefile.com/plans-pricing#1067240601-389406488-6)\n\nThe ShareFile Premium plans includes integrated electronic signature at no extra cost. With integrated e-signature, you can send files stored in your ShareFile account quickly for secure, legally binding e-signatures. Signed documents are saved automatically back to ShareFile, making the process seamless.\n\n      ![Image 12](https://sharefile.widen.net/content/fa538f29-5ab2-4463-b6a5-a02516d878e1/web/Website_3D_Stills_ShareFile_PROD_Stills_03_StructuredTowers_V005_JS__CC_V002_RS.jpg?crop=yes&k=c&w=480&h=480&itok=GAeU9WxB)\n\n#### Got questions?\n\nLet's talk about how we can create a solution that works for you.\n\n[#### We\u2019ve got answers Contact Sales](https://www.sharefile.com/contact-us)\n\n*   Product Features\n    *   [Client portal](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/client-portal)\n    *   [Integrated e-signature](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/integrated-e-signature)\n    *   [Regulatory compliance support](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/regulatory-compliance-support)\n    *   [Workflow automation](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/custom-workflow-automation)\n    *   [Rapid client onboarding](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/rapid-client-onboarding)\n    *   [Dedicated collaboration spaces](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/dedicated-collaboration-spaces)\n    *   [Template Library](https://www.sharefile.com/product-feature/template-library)\n\n*   Resources\n    *   [Help Center](https://support.sharefile.com/s/)\n    *   [Resource Center](https://www.sharefile.com/resource-center)\n    *   [Blog](https://www.sharefile.com/blogs)\n    *   [Events & Webinars](https://www.sharefile.com/events-webinars)\n    *   [Customer Stories](https://www.sharefile.com/customer-stories)\n    *   [FAQs](https://www.sharefile.com/faq)\n    *   [Apps & Integrations](https://www.sharefile.com/apps-integrations)\n    *   [Developers](https://api.sharefile.com/)\n    *   [Contact Us](https://www.sharefile.com/contact-us)\n\n*   Solutions\n    *   [Accounting](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/accounting)\n    *   [Finance](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/finance)\n    *   [Insurance](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/insurance)\n    *   [Healthcare](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/healthcare)\n    *   [Legal](https://www.sharefile.com/industry/legal)\n    *   [Virtual Data Room](https://www.sharefile.com/plans/sharefile-virtual-data-room)\n\nFollow Us\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sharefile)\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/Sharefile)\n\n[X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/Sharefile)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Sharefile)\n\n[](https://www.progress.com/ \"Progress-logo\")ShareFile is part of the Progress product portfolio.
