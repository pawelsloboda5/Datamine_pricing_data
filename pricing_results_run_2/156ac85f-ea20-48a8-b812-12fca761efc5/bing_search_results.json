Changes and saving may apply. All prices listed in USD.\n\n### **Questions? We have Answers.**\n\n**What is included in a Free Account? When does the account expire?**\n\nA Free Account gives you 30 days to test drive LMN Professional. You can use all features of the software during the trial period.\n\nWhile we do offer customer support during your free trial, setup and implementation is not included.\n\nYou can also get a live, [60-minute demo](https://golmn.com/live-demo-signup/) of the software to learn about the features and functionality.\n\n**What is the difference between LMN Starter and LMN Professional plans?**\n\nThe LMN Starter plan is built for companies with 1-3 crews, and comes with the essential LMN features you need to grow. Starts with 1 Office Staff / Crew Lead and 5 Crew Member licenses.\n\nThe LMN Professional plan is for companies with 15-50+ employees, where efficiency, reducing waste, and improving your communication is the key to sustained growth. Starts with 3 Office Staff / Crew Lead and 15 Crew Member licenses.\n\nCertain features, like job costing and ACH payment processing, are available in LMN Professional but not in the Starter plan. Please review our [feature list](https://golmn.com/test-plans-pricing/#compare-features) or [book a meeting](https://golmn.com/demo/schedule-meeting/) to learn more.\n\n**What is the difference between Office/Crew Licenses and Crew Member Licenses?**\n\nOffice/Crew Lead licenses are for anyone who accesses LMN\u2019s main dashboard and enters, manipulates, or deletes data. They are also for crew leads who log time and update job information.\n\nCrew Member licenses are for any crew member that you need to track on timesheets, export for payroll hours, and have access to the LMN Crew app.\n\nCrew members will be able to view their schedule, job files, hours worked, and personal timesheet in LMN Crew, but will not be able to clock in themselves. Crew licenses are sold in packs of 5.\n\n**Can I pause my account or pay less during my off season?**\n\nThere is no option to pause your account or pay reduced subscription fees. However, you can deactivate monthly user licenses when they are not being used.\n\nYou can add user licenses at any time.\n\n**How hard is it to get my data into LMN. Can you help me?**\n\nEvery paid LMN subscription comes with LMN Launch \u2013 our program that ensures you get up and running.\n\nLMN Starter Launch includes guided, group setup sessions. You bring your documentation to the session, and we\u2019ll help you customize your LMN experience. LMN Starter Launch **does not include** any direct data entry or upload.\n\nLMN Professional Launch, Premium Launch, and Enterprise Launch offer one-to-one guided setup and **includes** direct data upload. Please see our [Launch page](https://golmn.com/launch) to learn more.\n\n**How long does it take to get up and running with LMN?**\n\nThis will depend on you and your schedule. Most companies can expect to spend about **27 hours** spread across **4-6 weeks** to get up and running. This time is spread across your team and tailored specifically to their organizational role.\n\nPlease see our [Launch page](https://golmn.com/launch) to learn more.\n\n**Have additional questions?**  \n[Book some time with a product expert here.](https://golmn.com/demo/schedule-meeting/)\n\nLMN offers plans that work for landscape companies of any size.

Changes and saving may apply. All prices listed in USD.\n\n### **Questions? We have Answers.**\n\n**What is included in a Free Account? When does the account expire?**\n\nA Free Account gives you 30 days to test drive LMN Professional. You can use all features of the software during the trial period.\n\nWhile we do offer customer support during your free trial, setup and implementation is not included.\n\nYou can also get a live, [60-minute demo](https://golmn.com/live-demo-signup/) of the software to learn about the features and functionality.\n\n**What is the difference between LMN Starter and LMN Professional plans?**\n\nThe LMN Starter plan is built for companies with 1-3 crews, and comes with the essential LMN features you need to grow. Starts with 1 Office Staff / Crew Lead and 5 Crew Member licenses.\n\nThe LMN Professional plan is for companies with 15-50+ employees, where efficiency, reducing waste, and improving your communication is the key to sustained growth. Starts with 3 Office Staff / Crew Lead and 15 Crew Member licenses.\n\nCertain features, like job costing and ACH payment processing, are available in LMN Professional but not in the Starter plan. Please review our [feature list](https://golmn.com/test-plans-pricing/#compare-features) or [book a meeting](https://golmn.com/demo/schedule-meeting/) to learn more.\n\n**What is the difference between Office/Crew Licenses and Crew Member Licenses?**\n\nOffice/Crew Lead licenses are for anyone who accesses LMN\u2019s main dashboard and enters, manipulates, or deletes data. They are also for crew leads who log time and update job information.\n\nCrew Member licenses are for any crew member that you need to track on timesheets, export for payroll hours, and have access to the LMN Crew app.\n\nCrew members will be able to view their schedule, job files, hours worked, and personal timesheet in LMN Crew, but will not be able to clock in themselves. Crew licenses are sold in packs of 5.\n\n**Can I pause my account or pay less during my off season?**\n\nThere is no option to pause your account or pay reduced subscription fees. However, you can deactivate monthly user licenses when they are not being used.\n\nYou can add user licenses at any time.\n\n**How hard is it to get my data into LMN. Can you help me?**\n\nEvery paid LMN subscription comes with LMN Launch \u2013 our program that ensures you get up and running.\n\nLMN Starter Launch includes guided, group setup sessions. You bring your documentation to the session, and we\u2019ll help you customize your LMN experience. LMN Starter Launch **does not include** any direct data entry or upload.\n\nLMN Professional Launch, Premium Launch, and Enterprise Launch offer one-to-one guided setup and **includes** direct data upload. Please see our [Launch page](https://golmn.com/launch) to learn more.\n\n**How long does it take to get up and running with LMN?**\n\nThis will depend on you and your schedule. Most companies can expect to spend about **27 hours** spread across **4-6 weeks** to get up and running. This time is spread across your team and tailored specifically to their organizational role.\n\nPlease see our [Launch page](https://golmn.com/launch) to learn more.\n\n**Have additional questions?**  \n[Book some time with a product expert here.](https://golmn.com/demo/schedule-meeting/)\n\nLMN offers plans that work for landscape companies of any size.
