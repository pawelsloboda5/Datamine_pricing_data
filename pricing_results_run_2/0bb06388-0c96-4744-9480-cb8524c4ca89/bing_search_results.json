These message types are: product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels.\n\n\u2018Messages Sent\u2019 is calculated by totaling all messages sent through product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels during a billing month.\n\nThe baseline monthly fee for \u2018Proactive Support Plus\u2019 includes 500 Messages Sent every month. Usage above this amount will be charged per unit (see additional usage question above).\n\nFor example: If you send 1000 product tours, 1000 surveys, and 2000 mobile push messages during a billing month, your \u2018Messages Sent\u2019 total for that billing month would be 4000. Since the first 500 \u2018Messages Sent\u2019 are included each billing month, they are free. Only the additional 3500 Messages Sent\u2019 would be billed as an additional charge.\n\n[Learn more about \u2018Messages Sent\u2019](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9061648-proactive-support-plus#h_45c5377e15)\n\nWhat apps and integrations does Intercom offer?\n\nIntercom provides over 450+ apps and integrations, including Salesforce, Hubspot, and Jira.\n\n[Learn more about apps and integrations](https://www.intercom.com/app-store?on_pageview_event=nav)\n\nDo you offer discounts for startups?\n\nIntercom offers an Early Stage program for eligible startups.
