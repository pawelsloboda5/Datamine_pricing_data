How does the trial work?\n    \n    Yes, there is a free trial for 7-day or 50 contacted prospects. Whichever limit you reach first applies. You start the trial when you create an account in Woodpecker. During the trial, you have access to all Woodpecker features. You can also contact 50 prospects for free during the trial to test Woodpecker.\n    \n*   ### What happens when the trial ends? Can I extend my trial?\n    \n    Yes, you can extend your trial if you need more time. You also keep your access to Woodpecker after your trial ends. You can extend your trial by writing to us via the chat in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n    \n*   ### Do you automatically upgrade to a higher plan when reaching the limits of the current plan?\n    \n    No, your plan will not be automatically upgraded. You can upgrade the plan by yourself if you'd like that.\n    \n*   ### What happens if I exceed the limits in my plan? (contacted or stored prospects)\n    \n    If you exceed the limit of \"contacted prospects\", the campaign won't send new emails to new prospects.  \n    To contact new prospects you can upgrade to a higher limit or wait until the limit renews on your billing date.  \n      \n    \"Stored prospects\" is a metric that doesn't renew. If you exceed the stored prospects limit, you won't be able to add new prospects to your database and campaigns. To add new prospects you can either upgrade or remove prospects from the database.\n    \n*   ### What happens to the plan limits if I add the same prospect in 5 different campaigns?\n    \n    It counts as 1 prospect in your \"stored prospects\" limit. It counts as 5 in your \"contacted prospects\".\n    \n\nAnd you won't have to pay for these...\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   ![Image 33: Address validation for free](https://woodpecker.co/wp-content/themes/woodpecker-co/assets/pricing-v4/email-validation.svg) Unlimited email address validation for free\n*   ![Image 34: Team members for free](https://woodpecker.co/wp-content/themes/woodpecker-co/assets/pricing-v4/email-team.svg) Unlimited team members for free\n*   ![Image 35: Email accounts for free](https://woodpecker.co/wp-content/themes/woodpecker-co/assets/pricing-v4/email-account.svg) Unlimited email accounts for free\n\nHow hard is it to start?

How does the trial work?\n    \n    Yes, there is a free trial for 7-day or 50 contacted prospects. Whichever limit you reach first applies. You start the trial when you create an account in Woodpecker. During the trial, you have access to all Woodpecker features. You can also contact 50 prospects for free during the trial to test Woodpecker.\n    \n*   ### What happens when the trial ends? Can I extend my trial?\n    \n    Yes, you can extend your trial if you need more time. You also keep your access to Woodpecker after your trial ends. You can extend your trial by writing to us via the chat in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n    \n*   ### Do you automatically upgrade to a higher plan when reaching the limits of the current plan?\n    \n    No, your plan will not be automatically upgraded. You can upgrade the plan by yourself if you'd like that.\n    \n*   ### What happens if I exceed the limits in my plan? (contacted or stored prospects)\n    \n    If you exceed the limit of \"contacted prospects\", the campaign won't send new emails to new prospects.  \n    To contact new prospects you can upgrade to a higher limit or wait until the limit renews on your billing date.  \n      \n    \"Stored prospects\" is a metric that doesn't renew. If you exceed the stored prospects limit, you won't be able to add new prospects to your database and campaigns. To add new prospects you can either upgrade or remove prospects from the database.\n    \n*   ### What happens to the plan limits if I add the same prospect in 5 different campaigns?\n    \n    It counts as 1 prospect in your \"stored prospects\" limit. It counts as 5 in your \"contacted prospects\".\n    \n\nAnd you won't have to pay for these...\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   ![Image 33: Address validation for free](https://woodpecker.co/wp-content/themes/woodpecker-co/assets/pricing-v4/email-validation.svg) Unlimited email address validation for free\n*   ![Image 34: Team members for free](https://woodpecker.co/wp-content/themes/woodpecker-co/assets/pricing-v4/email-team.svg) Unlimited team members for free\n*   ![Image 35: Email accounts for free](https://woodpecker.co/wp-content/themes/woodpecker-co/assets/pricing-v4/email-account.svg) Unlimited email accounts for free\n\nHow hard is it to start?
