Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### So what's a Candidate Pool?\n\nCandidate pools help you to manage, organize & nurture relationships with candidates who are not necessarily affiliated with a specific role. They're a simple way to manage the full candidate funnel, while making sure you always have great talent in the pipeline for future roles.\n\n![Image 1](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6127d83f257132e4fe0bddc6/6137643fb278b319928938f6_breezy-flyingpig.webp)\n\n### What's an active Position or Candidate Pool?  \n\nEssentially, \u201cactive status\u201d means candidates are able to apply or be added. For a position, being active also means it can be listed on your public Career Portal and can be distributed to third-party job boards. For both candidate pools and positions, being active allows you to communicate with candidates \u2014 exchanging emails, scheduling interviews, etc.\n\n### How many positions are included with the Bootstrap plan?  \n\nThe Bootstrap plan includes one active position or candidate pool at a time. You can create as many as you like, but will need to close or archive one before activating another.\n\n### How long can I access my candidates with the Bootstrap plan?  \n\nThe Bootstrap plan includes unlimited access to recent candidates (added within the last 30 days). You can add and access as many candidates as you like, but will need to upgrade to a paid plan to access candidates older than 30 days.\n\n### Where have you been all my life?  \n\nLet's not talk about the past. We're here now. Let's make the most of it. \ud83d\ude0d\n\nAre you ready?\n\nStart optimizing your recruiting process today.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the thousands of companies already hiring with Breezy HR.\n\nFull Feature 14-Day Trial\n\nNo Credit Card Needed\n\nBreezy offers simple, flexible pricing perfect for small businesses and fast-growing companies.
