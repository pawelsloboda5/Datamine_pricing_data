We are aware that pricing is a crucial factor in your evaluation process and therefore, we would like to discuss this with you and align the offer to your exact needs. Our pricing begins with a base price and you can add-on additional features depending on your use cases.\n\nHow is the base price calculated?\n\nThe base price is depending on the data packages you need, based on the geographies that your business is selling to. We first learn where you would like to sell, then how many of your employees need to have access to Dealfront and what type of actions they need to perform, and try to understand your needed lead flow. Using this information, we provide you with the most suitable options that can accommodate your budget.\n\nWhich are the products included in the Sales Intelligence Solution?\n\nDealfront\u2019s Sales Intelligence Solution includes [Target](https://www.dealfront.com/target/), [Connect](https://www.dealfront.com/connect/) and [Datacare](https://www.dealfront.com/datacare/). Empower your revenue teams with comprehensive insights into companies that matter. Identify accounts exhibiting genuine buying intent, pinpoint key decision-makers, access their direct contact details, and seamlessly integrate with your CRM for streamlined operations.\n\nWhere does the data come from?\n\nAll data on Dealfront is built using official trade registers, enriched by public web data, and then cross-referenced with directory records. We have developed a neural network that analyzes all relevant public content, like websites, trade register descriptions, and more. Our self-designed crawler technologies also automatically extract contact details from all available online sources like social media profiles, news articles, trade registers, and diverse databases.\n\nWhat makes our data unique?\n\nDealfront owns the largest B2B database to uncover and accelerate revenue opportunities in Europe, with up-to-date 360\u00b0company profiles and truly compliant data powered by and continuously improved with machine learning. We also provide uniquely deep data that helps you prioritize your target account lists and highlight true buying intent. Finally, with our IP database, we can reveal what companies your web visitors work for, even if they are working remotely as well as target them with B2B ads while they work.\n\nIs this data GDPR compliant?\n\nDealfront\u2019s data is truly compliant and meets the highest data protection and privacy standards. Please visit our [Compliance and GDPR page](https://www.dealfront.com/gdpr/) for more information on this topic.\n\nIs our Sales Intelligence Solution right for you?\n\nWe value your time and want to ensure a perfect fit for your needs. At Dealfront, we specialize in offering tailored solutions for B2B companies in the European market and beyond. However, there are certain types of businesses that might not find our solutions suitable. Please review the following criteria to determine if we are the right vendor for your requirements:\n\n**B2C Companies**\n\nWe focus on providing B2B sales intelligence for sales and marketing teams that sell in the European market. Unfortunately, we do not cater to businesses that primarily operate in the B2C space.\n\n**Companies selling outside of Europe**\n\nCurrently, our data is primarily focused on European geos. As a result, we regret that we cannot accommodate businesses whose main objective is to sell in markets outside of Europe.\n\n**Companies Lacking Market Segmentation**\n\nOur platform thrives on delivering targeted insights. If your business does not utilize target market segmentation strategies, we may not be the best fit for your current needs.\n\n**Data Resellers**\n\nIf your intention is to purchase data from our platform for reselling purposes, we are unable to support this use case. However, if you are interested in partnering with us to spread the network of companies that offer our solution, we would like to hear from you at [partnerships@dealfront.com](mailto:partnerships@dealfront.com)\n\nOur mission is to empower B2B businesses to thrive in their respective markets. If your company aligns with the outlined criteria above, we're excited to discuss how our solutions can bring value to your operations.\n\n[](https://www.dealfront.com/)\n\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dealfront/ \"Visit our LinkedIn.\")[](https://www.instagram.com/getdealfront/ \"Visit our Instagram.\")[](https://www.facebook.com/getdealfront/ \"Visit our Facebook.\")[](https://twitter.com/getdealfront/ \"Visit our Twitter.\")\n\nProduct\n\n[Platform Overview](https://www.dealfront.com/platform/) [Target](https://www.dealfront.com/target/) [Leadfeeder](https://www.dealfront.com/web-visitors/) [Promote](https://www.dealfront.com/promote/) [Connect](https://www.dealfront.com/connect/) [Datacare](https://www.dealfront.com/datacare/)\n\nResources\n\n[Blog](https://www.dealfront.com/blog/) [Integrations](https://www.dealfront.com/integrations/) [Our Data](https://www.dealfront.com/our-data/) [GDPR & Compliance](https://www.dealfront.com/gdpr/) [Privacy Center](https://www.dealfront.com/privacy-center/) [Your data in Dealfront](https://privacycockpit.dealfront.com/?ajs_aid=4c8eac57-4878-4481-ab22-2c2ccc2e5c74)[Pricing](https://www.dealfront.com/pricing/)\n\nCompany\n\n[About Us](https://www.dealfront.com/about/) [Careers \ud83d\ude80 Hiring!](https://www.dealfront.com/careers/)\n\nSupport\n\n[Help Center](https://help.dealfront.com/en/?ajs_aid=4c8eac57-4878-4481-ab22-2c2ccc2e5c74)[Academy](https://www.dealfront.com/resources/academy/)[Contact & Imprint](https://www.dealfront.com/contact/)\n\n\u00a9 2025 Dealfront Group GmbH.
