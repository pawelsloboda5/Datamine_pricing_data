questions\n--------------------------\n\n*   ### Are plans commitment-free?\n    \n    You decide: you can pay monthly, and commit on a month-to-month basis or you can pay yearly, and commit for 12 months following your subscription. You can manage and change your subscription directly in the application.\n    \n*   ### Are signatures collected during my trial period legally binding?\n    \n    Yes. Every single signature processed through our app complies to security norms and generate legally binding proof of agreement. Moreover, all signatures created during the trial period will remain available in the application.\n    \n*   ### How do I subscribe to a plan?\n    \n    At any time during your trial period, you can confirm your subscription to Yousign directly in the application. Once you've entered your bank details and billing information, your plan will be immediately activated.\n    \n*   ### How can I pay?\n    \n    Payment methods accepted are credit card and direct debit. In the app, you\u2019ll be able to set up credit card payments. Get in touch with our team if you\u2019d prefer to be billed using a different payment method.\n    \n*   ### How will I be billed?\n    \n    If you\u2019ve picked monthly billing, you will be billed each month. If you\u2019ve selected annual billing, you will pay your yearly amount upfront.\n    \n\n*   ### What happens when I hit my signature request limits?\n    \n    Aside from the One plan, you can create as many signature requests as you want. If you reach your signature limit with One, you'll still be able to create drafts and send them the month afterwards, or change plan in your application.\n    \n*   ### What is a 'Signature request'?\n    \n    An invitation to sign is the whole operation of preparing and sending one or more documents to be signed electronically by one or more signers at once. It can contain as many documents as you want and up to 100 signers.\n    \n*   ### Do Yousign's electronic signatures have a time-stamped certificate?\n    \n    All our simple and advanced eSignatures are time-stamped, regardless of the offer. The timestamp is included in the evidence file (document attesting to the signature, which can be downloaded as an annex to each signature procedure).\n    \n*   ### What is the FREE plan?\n    \n    The FREE plan gives you access to a secure & legally binding eSignature solution. With this plan, you can discover the benefits of using Yousign for free. The plan allows you to self-sign your own documents (unlimited) and send 2 invitations to sign/month. Certain features are accessible only on paying plans. Please check the feature-per-feature comparison of each plan for more information.\n    \n*   ### Who can subscribe to the FREE plan?\n    \n    Anyone can subscribe to the FREE plan. You can subscribe to the FREE plan for your professional use or for your private or household use. Different terms and conditions apply though. Please check our [Terms of use and subscription](https://yousign.com/terms) for more information.\n    \n\nTheir agreements are powered by Yousign\n\n*   ![Image 43: Shine](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/shine@2x.863d961.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 44: Sellsy](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/sellsy_black@2x.fa681a0.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 45: Lifen](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/lifen@2x.79a6e52.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 46: Bpi](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/BPIfrance_@2x.6c3bacd.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 47: Agicap](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/agicap@2x.97858a4.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 48: Konbini](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/Konbini_@2x.57701d5.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 49: Matera](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/matera_black.0bb0173.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 50: Leocare](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/leocare.80ae4a3.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 51: Shine](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/shine@2x.863d961.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 52: Sellsy](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/sellsy_black@2x.fa681a0.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 53: Lifen](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/lifen@2x.79a6e52.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 54: Bpi](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/BPIfrance_@2x.6c3bacd.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 55: Agicap](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/agicap@2x.97858a4.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 56: Konbini](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/Konbini_@2x.57701d5.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 57: Matera](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/matera_black.0bb0173.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 58: Leocare](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/leocare.80ae4a3.png)\n    \n\nand 25,000+ other beloved companies\n\nStart your free trial\n\nSign up now to start your 14-day free trial and sign your documents online.\n\n     \n\n![Image 59: green arrow](blob:http://localhost/422429a41a3b418e562112da21665dba)\n\n![Image 60: cta illustration](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/illustration-cta-en.0601472.svg)\n\n*   Company\n    \n    *   [About us](https://yousign.com/about-us)\n    *   [Work with us Hiring](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/companies/yousign/jobs)\n    *   [Partners](https://yousign.com/partners)\n    *   [Blog](https://yousign.com/blog)\n    \n    NewYousign for individuals\n    \n    [Discover](https://yousign.com/electronic-signature-freemium)\n    \n*   Products\n    \n    *   [Application](https://yousign.com/application)\n    *   [API](https://yousign.com/api)\n    *   [Features](https://yousign.com/features)\n    *   [Application pricing](https://yousign.com/pricing-application)\n    *   [API pricing](https://yousign.com/pricing-api)\n    *   [Use cases](https://yousign.com/use-cases)\n    *   [Zapier](https://yousign.com/integrations/zapier)\n    *   [Reviews](https://yousign.com/reviews)\n*   Need help\n    \n    *   [Contact us](https://yousign.com/contact)\n    *   [Help Center](https://help.yousign.app/en)\n    *   [Developer Center](https://yousign.com/developers)\n    *   [Guides](https://yousign.com/guides)\n*   Electronic Signature\n    \n    *   [eSignature software](https://yousign.com/electronic-signature-software)\n    *   [What is eSignature](https://yousign.com/electronic-signature)\n    *   [How to sign electronically](https://yousign.com/how-to-sign-electronically)\n    *   [Sign a Word document](https://yousign.com/how-to-sign-word-documents)\n    *   [Sign your PDF](https://yousign.com/sign-pdf-documents-online)\n    *   [Alternative to DocuSign](https://yousign.com/docusign-alternative)\n*   Security\n    \n    *   [eSignature in Europe](https://yousign.com/legality-electronic-signature-europe)\n    *   [Certifications](https://yousign.com/digital-signature-certificate)\n    *   [eIDAS](https://yousign.com/eidas)\n    *   [Yousign & Security](https://yousign.com/security)\n\nNewYousign for individuals\n\n[Discover](https://yousign.com/electronic-signature-freemium)\n\n*   [Deutschland](https://yousign.com/de-de/preise-app)\n*   [Espa\u00f1a](https://yousign.com/es-es/precios-aplicacion)\n*   [France](https://yousign.com/fr-fr/prix-application)\n*   [Italia](https://yousign.com/it-it/prezzi-app)\n\n*   [](https://twitter.com/yousignEU)\n    \n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yousign/)\n    \n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/c/YousignYT/)\n    \n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/yousignlife/)\n    \n\n4.5/5\n\n![Image 61: G2 logo european leader](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/E-Signature_Leader_France_Leader.937afb1.png) ![Image 62: G2 logo high performer](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/E-Signature_HighPerformer_Mid-Market_HighPerformer.5b94073.png)\n\n[![Image 63: B Corp](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/b-corp-en.26714d6.svg)](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/yousign/)\n\n\u00a9 Yousign -

questions\n--------------------------\n\n*   ### Are plans commitment-free?\n    \n    You decide: you can pay monthly, and commit on a month-to-month basis or you can pay yearly, and commit for 12 months following your subscription. You can manage and change your subscription directly in the application.\n    \n*   ### Are signatures collected during my trial period legally binding?\n    \n    Yes. Every single signature processed through our app complies to security norms and generate legally binding proof of agreement. Moreover, all signatures created during the trial period will remain available in the application.\n    \n*   ### How do I subscribe to a plan?\n    \n    At any time during your trial period, you can confirm your subscription to Yousign directly in the application. Once you've entered your bank details and billing information, your plan will be immediately activated.\n    \n*   ### How can I pay?\n    \n    Payment methods accepted are credit card and direct debit. In the app, you\u2019ll be able to set up credit card payments. Get in touch with our team if you\u2019d prefer to be billed using a different payment method.\n    \n*   ### How will I be billed?\n    \n    If you\u2019ve picked monthly billing, you will be billed each month. If you\u2019ve selected annual billing, you will pay your yearly amount upfront.\n    \n\n*   ### What happens when I hit my signature request limits?\n    \n    Aside from the One plan, you can create as many signature requests as you want. If you reach your signature limit with One, you'll still be able to create drafts and send them the month afterwards, or change plan in your application.\n    \n*   ### What is a 'Signature request'?\n    \n    An invitation to sign is the whole operation of preparing and sending one or more documents to be signed electronically by one or more signers at once. It can contain as many documents as you want and up to 100 signers.\n    \n*   ### Do Yousign's electronic signatures have a time-stamped certificate?\n    \n    All our simple and advanced eSignatures are time-stamped, regardless of the offer. The timestamp is included in the evidence file (document attesting to the signature, which can be downloaded as an annex to each signature procedure).\n    \n*   ### What is the FREE plan?\n    \n    The FREE plan gives you access to a secure & legally binding eSignature solution. With this plan, you can discover the benefits of using Yousign for free. The plan allows you to self-sign your own documents (unlimited) and send 2 invitations to sign/month. Certain features are accessible only on paying plans. Please check the feature-per-feature comparison of each plan for more information.\n    \n*   ### Who can subscribe to the FREE plan?\n    \n    Anyone can subscribe to the FREE plan. You can subscribe to the FREE plan for your professional use or for your private or household use. Different terms and conditions apply though. Please check our [Terms of use and subscription](https://yousign.com/terms) for more information.\n    \n\nTheir agreements are powered by Yousign\n\n*   ![Image 43: Shine](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/shine@2x.863d961.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 44: Sellsy](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/sellsy_black@2x.fa681a0.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 45: Lifen](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/lifen@2x.79a6e52.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 46: Bpi](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/BPIfrance_@2x.6c3bacd.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 47: Agicap](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/agicap@2x.97858a4.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 48: Konbini](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/Konbini_@2x.57701d5.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 49: Matera](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/matera_black.0bb0173.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 50: Leocare](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/leocare.80ae4a3.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 51: Shine](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/shine@2x.863d961.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 52: Sellsy](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/sellsy_black@2x.fa681a0.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 53: Lifen](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/lifen@2x.79a6e52.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 54: Bpi](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/BPIfrance_@2x.6c3bacd.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 55: Agicap](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/agicap@2x.97858a4.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 56: Konbini](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/Konbini_@2x.57701d5.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 57: Matera](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/matera_black.0bb0173.png)\n    \n*   ![Image 58: Leocare](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/leocare.80ae4a3.png)\n    \n\nand 25,000+ other beloved companies\n\nStart your free trial\n\nSign up now to start your 14-day free trial and sign your documents online.\n\n     \n\n![Image 59: green arrow](blob:http://localhost/422429a41a3b418e562112da21665dba)\n\n![Image 60: cta illustration](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/illustration-cta-en.0601472.svg)\n\n*   Company\n    \n    *   [About us](https://yousign.com/about-us)\n    *   [Work with us Hiring](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/companies/yousign/jobs)\n    *   [Partners](https://yousign.com/partners)\n    *   [Blog](https://yousign.com/blog)\n    \n    NewYousign for individuals\n    \n    [Discover](https://yousign.com/electronic-signature-freemium)\n    \n*   Products\n    \n    *   [Application](https://yousign.com/application)\n    *   [API](https://yousign.com/api)\n    *   [Features](https://yousign.com/features)\n    *   [Application pricing](https://yousign.com/pricing-application)\n    *   [API pricing](https://yousign.com/pricing-api)\n    *   [Use cases](https://yousign.com/use-cases)\n    *   [Zapier](https://yousign.com/integrations/zapier)\n    *   [Reviews](https://yousign.com/reviews)\n*   Need help\n    \n    *   [Contact us](https://yousign.com/contact)\n    *   [Help Center](https://help.yousign.app/en)\n    *   [Developer Center](https://yousign.com/developers)\n    *   [Guides](https://yousign.com/guides)\n*   Electronic Signature\n    \n    *   [eSignature software](https://yousign.com/electronic-signature-software)\n    *   [What is eSignature](https://yousign.com/electronic-signature)\n    *   [How to sign electronically](https://yousign.com/how-to-sign-electronically)\n    *   [Sign a Word document](https://yousign.com/how-to-sign-word-documents)\n    *   [Sign your PDF](https://yousign.com/sign-pdf-documents-online)\n    *   [Alternative to DocuSign](https://yousign.com/docusign-alternative)\n*   Security\n    \n    *   [eSignature in Europe](https://yousign.com/legality-electronic-signature-europe)\n    *   [Certifications](https://yousign.com/digital-signature-certificate)\n    *   [eIDAS](https://yousign.com/eidas)\n    *   [Yousign & Security](https://yousign.com/security)\n\nNewYousign for individuals\n\n[Discover](https://yousign.com/electronic-signature-freemium)\n\n*   [Deutschland](https://yousign.com/de-de/preise-app)\n*   [Espa\u00f1a](https://yousign.com/es-es/precios-aplicacion)\n*   [France](https://yousign.com/fr-fr/prix-application)\n*   [Italia](https://yousign.com/it-it/prezzi-app)\n\n*   [](https://twitter.com/yousignEU)\n    \n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yousign/)\n    \n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/c/YousignYT/)\n    \n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/yousignlife/)\n    \n\n4.5/5\n\n![Image 61: G2 logo european leader](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/E-Signature_Leader_France_Leader.937afb1.png) ![Image 62: G2 logo high performer](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/E-Signature_HighPerformer_Mid-Market_HighPerformer.5b94073.png)\n\n[![Image 63: B Corp](https://yousign.com/_nuxt/img/b-corp-en.26714d6.svg)](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/yousign/)\n\n\u00a9 Yousign -
