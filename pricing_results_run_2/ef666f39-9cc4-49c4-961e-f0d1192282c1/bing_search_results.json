You just need to add a small piece of JavaScript code on every page where you want your campaigns to run.\n\n\uf061\n\n#### DO I NEED TO BE A DEVELOPER TO USE VIRAL LOOPS?  \n\nNope. Creating and launching campaigns is easy as 1-2-3. You will just need to be able to install our JavaScript code to your website to launch your campaigns. A little bit of HTML knowledge is all that's necessary to do that.

At any point during your trial, choose the plan that suits you best and subscribe using your credit card.\n\n\uf061\n\n#### WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF MY TRIAL?  \n\nIf you have not subscribed to any plan by the end of your trial, your campaigns will continue receiving submissions but you will not be able to create new ones. You won't be able to access them and export the emails you have collected. You will need to subscribe to one of our plans in order to access your campaigns!\n\n\uf061\n\n#### I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.
