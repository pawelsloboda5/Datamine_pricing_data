work?\n\nMindee\u2019s pricing is designed to be simple, transparent, and scalable to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes. Our pricing is primarily volume-based, which means you pay according to the number of pages processed by our API.  \n  \n**We offer two main options:  \n**  \n**\\- Pay-as-you-go (Volume-based only)**: Ideal for businesses that prefer flexibility, this model allows you to pay only for the pages you process at $0.10 per page.  \n  \n**\\- Enterprise subscription (Yearly subscription + Volume-based Pricing)**: For companies with higher and more consistent usage, this model includes a yearly subscription with a discounted rate for each page processed. This option provides access to premium features, enhanced support, and the ability to create custom models with our team.\n\nHow do we calculate the number of pages?\n\nThe number of pages is calculated based on the number of physical pages sent through the API for processing.  \n  \nFor example:  \n\\-**Single-page documents**: A single-page invoice or receipt counts as one page.  \n\\-**Multi-page documents**: A three-page contract counts as three pages.  \n\\-**Long receipts or invoices**: If a receipt or invoice exceeds one page, each additional page is counted as a separate page.  \n  \nThis straightforward approach ensures fairness and clarity. No hidden fees \u2014 you\u2019re billed only for what you process.\n\nWhat are your pre trained models?\n\nMindee offers a selection of powerful, ready-to-use models that allow you to extract data from specific document types with high accuracy.  \n  \nOur pre-trained models include (not limited to) :  \n  \n\\- **Invoice API**: Extract key data such as supplier details, invoice numbers, payment terms, and line items.  \n\\- **Receipt API**: Extract key details from receipts, such as merchant name, transaction date, total amount, and taxes.  \n\\- **Bank Statement API**: Parse and extract key information from bank statements, including transaction dates, amounts, and descriptions.  \n\\- **ID Document API**: Extract data from IDs such as names, dates of birth, and ID numbers.  \n  \nThese models are constantly evolving, and we\u2019re committed to providing the highest level of accuracy and performance. For unique needs, we also offer the ability to create **custom models** tailored to your specific document type.\n\nWhat is the volume based pricing for Enterprise?\u00a0\n\nFor Enterprise clients, our volume-based pricing is customized to align with your document processing needs and usage.  \n  \nLarger volumes benefit from discounted per-page rates.  \n  \nEnterprise clients also gain access to additional benefits, such as:  \n\\- **Custom pricing**: Based on expected page volume, ensuring competitive rates.  \n\\- **Dedicated support**: Priority support to ensure rapid issue resolution.  \n\\- **Custom models**: Access to tailored models for your unique document types.  \n\\- **Workflow access**: Option to include platform fees for full-workflow access.  \n  \nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Enterprise pricing, our team is available to discuss your requirements and offer a personalized quote based on your specific use case and document volume.\n\n![Image 39: A background colour with mindee colours](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65560eafdce64b3d914e8e4f/6763d834fc40e9a4afc63194_Design%20sans%20titre%20(2).png)\n\nTrusted by experts\n------------------\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine any other partner for receipt OCR in the future.
