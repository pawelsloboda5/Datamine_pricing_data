If you want to create a custom WordPress form, then you need to use Formidable Forms. Our mission is to empower freelancers and agencies to create advanced, solution-focused forms with confidence.\n\n[Do you offer a trial?](https://formidableforms.com/pricing/#)\n\nYou can get a good feel for the form maker plugin by installing our [free WordPress forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/formidable/). Additionally, we offer a full **money-back guarantee for 14 days**. If Formidable Forms doesn't meet your needs, you can [contact us](https://formidableforms.com/new-topic/) for a full refund.\n\n[How long will I receive support and updates?](https://formidableforms.com/pricing/#)\n\nAfter your license expires, renewal is required for continued access to support, plugin updates, and new addons for your plan. Add-ons released for your plan while your support is active are included. Those released after expiry are not available without renewal. If your license has expired, get details on [how to renew](https://formidableforms.com/knowledgebase/manage-licenses-and-sites/#kb-renewing).\n\nRenewal covers a full year of support, plugin updates, and access to any new add-ons we release during that year for your plan.\n\nAccess to download form and style templates for free is available for download with current Elite support. If support is expired, access to download these templates will also expire.\n\n[What level of support can I expect?](https://formidableforms.com/pricing/#)\n\nSupport is our highest priority. We want you to succeed with your endeavors and we are here to back you up. Different levels of support help our team prioritize the order in which tickets are handled. Those with **Elite** support can plan on hearing from our team within 4 business hours. Those with **Priority** support are next in the ticket queue, and can generally expect the first response within 6 business hours. **Standard** support tickets will receive a response within 12 business hours.\n\nOur support covers all built-in features. It is up to you to install the plugin and setup everything you need. If you have questions, we provide you with instructions to help you get the results you want.\n\nIf your request requires code beyond the built-in features, we will point you towards a similar code example if available. Writing, customizing, and troubleshooting any type of custom code (HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript) is up to you or the developer you hire.\n\n[Can I have a development site?](https://formidableforms.com/pricing/#)\n\nYes. You can set up any number of local sites and a staging site with a specific subdomain. The options include staging.yoursite.com, dev.yoursite.com, test.yoursite.com, local.yoursite.com, or beta.yoursite.com for the URL. If you have a WP multi-site install, our support covers the main site if you have support for a single-site.\n\n[Can I upgrade my license later?](https://formidableforms.com/pricing/#)\n\nOf course. You can upgrade your license at any time from your [licenses page](https://formidableforms.com/account/licenses/). Learn more about how to upgrade an existing license [how to upgrade an existing license](https://formidableforms.com/knowledgebase/manage-licenses-and-sites/upgrading-your-licenses/).\n\n[Will I get access to future add-ons?](https://formidableforms.com/pricing/#)\n\nWhen you purchase a plan, you get access to everything that is currently listed on the pricing page. As new add-ons are released, you will be able to add them at no charge while your license and support are current. If your support/license expires, renewal is required in order to get access to any new products for your plan.\n\n[What types of payment do you accept?](https://formidableforms.com/pricing/#)\n\nWe use PayPal and Stripe to process payments. They accept debit, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. Your credit card information is not stored on our site.\n\nStunning customer support (and a great product too). I\u2019ve been a database engineer for nearly 40 years and worked with some great products, but Formidable Forms provides real web based business solutions out of the box and at so little cost.\n\nCaryl Wills C1 Racing Club\n\nFormidable Forms is the most complete plug in service I\u2019ve found for WordPress. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve found comes even close to what the tools they offer and their solution and services category they provide.\n\n![Image 3: Offerscode](https://formidableforms.com/wp-content/themes/fp2015git/images/offerscode.jpg) Offerscode\n\nCompare All Form Maker and View Features\n----------------------------------------\n\nElite\n-----\n\nNormally $599  \n$299 .50 /year Save $300 (50%)\\* [Get Started](https://formidableforms.com/checkout?edd_action=add_to_cart&download_id=19366992&edd_options[price_id]=2&discount=50OFF)\n\nInstant Download\n\nBusiness\n--------\n\nMost Popular Normally $399  \n$199 .50 /year Save $200 (50%)\\* [Get Started](https://formidableforms.com/checkout?edd_action=add_to_cart&download_id=19366995&edd_options[price_id]=5&discount=50OFF)\n\nInstant Download\n\nPlus\n----\n\nNormally $199  \n$99 .50 /year Save $100 (50%)\\* [Get Started](https://formidableforms.com/checkout?edd_action=add_to_cart&download_id=20896934&edd_options[price_id]=3&discount=50OFF)\n\nInstant Download\n\nBasic\n-----\n\nNormally $79  \n$39 .50 /year Save $40 (50%)\\* [Get Started](https://formidableforms.com/checkout?edd_action=add_to_cart&download_id=28029934&edd_options[price_id]=1&discount=50OFF)\n\nInstant Download\n\nSupport Level\n\nElite\n\nPriority\n\nStandard\n\nStandard\n\n### Advanced Forms\n\nElite\n\nBusiness\n\nPlus\n\nBasic\n\nFile Uploads\n\nConditional Logic\n\nRepeater Fields\n\nConfirmation Fields\n\nCascading Dropdowns\n\nMulti-Page Forms\n\nReview Before Submit\n\nConditional Redirects\n\nForm Scheduling\n\nSpam Protection\n\nAdvanced Fields\n\nConditional Form Notifications\n\nForm Autoresponders\n\nImages for Radio Buttons\n\nMobile-Friendly Forms\n\nWCAG/A11Y Compliant Forms\n\nGlobal Currency Formatting\n\nCascading Locations Import\n\n\u2013\n\nUser Tracking\n\n\u2013\n\nSurveys and Polls\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nQuiz Maker\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nCalculator Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nConversational Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nForm Abandonment\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nUser Registration\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nDatepicker Options\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nSignatures\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nGeolocation\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n### Flexible Applications\n\nElite\n\nBusiness\n\nPlus\n\nBasic\n\nEntry Management\n\nApplication Organizer\n\nAdvanced Math\n\nCSV Import & Export\n\nImport/Export Forms & Styles\n\nCreate WordPress Posts\n\nCustom Post Submission\n\nSave and Continue Logged-in Drafts\n\nGraphs and Charts\n\n\u2013\n\nFront End Editing\n\n\u2013\n\nInline Editing\n\n\u2013\n\nMerge Fields in Post Content\n\n\u2013\n\nFormidable Views\n\n\u2013\n\nTable Views\n\n\u2013\n\nCalendar Views\n\n\u2013\n\nAdvanced View Filtering\n\n\u2013\n\nNested Views (Reviews & Comments)\n\n\u2013\n\nForms to PDF\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nExport Table View to CSV\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nSave and Continue Logged-out Drafts\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nAuto Save Drafts\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nPay to Post\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nWhite Label Form Builder\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nDirectory App Shortcuts\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nReal Estate App Shortcut\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nProduct Store App Shortcut\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nForm Templates\n\n325+\n\n320+\n\n145+\n\n100+\n\n### Automation\n\nElite\n\nBusiness\n\nPlus\n\nBasic\n\nFill Forms Automatically\n\nRepeater Actions\n\nChatGPT Integration\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nZapier Integration\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nFormidable Forms API\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nForm Action Automation\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n### Form Appearance\n\nElite\n\nBusiness\n\nPlus\n\nBasic\n\nVisual Form Styler\n\nForm Layouts\n\nCustom CSS\n\nCustomize HTML\n\nAJAX Form Submit\n\nLanding Pages\n\n\u2013\n\nBootstrap Modals\n\n\u2013\n\nBootstrap Form Styling\n\n\u2013\n\n### Integrations\n\nElite\n\nBusiness\n\nPlus\n\nBasic\n\nMailchimp Forms\n\n\u2013\n\nAWeber Forms\n\n\u2013\n\nConvertKit Forms\n\n\u2013\n\nMailPoet Newsletters\n\n\u2013\n\nStripe Transaction Fees\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nStripe Pro\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nPayPal\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nGoogle Sheets\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nConstant Contact Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nCampaign Monitor Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nGetResponse Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nACF Front-End Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nWPML Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nPolylang Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nTwilio SMS Notifications\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nTwilio SMS Voting\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nAuthorize.net AIM\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nWooCommerce Product Configurator\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nActiveCampaign Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nSalesforce Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nHubspot Forms\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nFormidable Forms Pro is full of powerful application builder features & integrations.
