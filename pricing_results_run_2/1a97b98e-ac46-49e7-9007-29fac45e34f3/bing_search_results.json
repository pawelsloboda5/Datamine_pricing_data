Cancel any time, no long-term contracts to lock you in. Simple, straightforward, and fair, just as it should be.\n\n### A big boost for bootstrappers & small businesses.\n\nWe started our business without outside funding, and you probably did too. We know your money\u2019s precious, and we want to help. That\u2019s why Basecamp is intentionally affordable for start-ups, freelancers, and small businesses just getting started.\n\n### Basecamp eliminates the Hassle Tax.\n\nThere\u2019s no more paying separate bills, onboarding people in multiple places, training people how to use different tools, managing expenses across vendors, etc\u2026 the benefits of Basecamp go beyond price.\n\n### I have questions about pricing\u2026\n\nCan we upgrade, downgrade, switch packages, or cancel whenever we want?\n\n**Yes, you can upgrade** from Free to Plus or from Plus to Pro Unlimited whenever you\u2019d like.\n\n**Yes, you can downgrade** from Pro Unlimited to Plus or Free as long as your usage fits on the lower package. For example, if you still had five projects, you couldn\u2019t downgrade to the Free package which only allows one project. You\u2019d have to delete four of those projects before downgrading.\n\n**Yes, you can cancel any time**, no questions asked, no forms to fill out, no person to talk to. If you cancel an annual package, the difference will be prorated back to your credit card.\n\nDo you offer non-profit or educational discounts?\n\n**Absolutely.** Basecamp is 10% off for registered 501(c)(3) non-profits, and 100% free for K-12, homeschoolers, or Universities as long as it\u2019s used for class work only.\n\n**For non-profits:** [Email us](mailto:nonprofits@basecamp.com) a copy of your 501(c)(3) paperwork right after you sign up. We\u2019ll apply the discount once we verify your status.\n\n**For teachers and homeschool parents:** Right after you sign up, [email us](mailto:teachers@basecamp.com) from your school account with the name of your school, the class you teach, and proof you\u2019re a teacher. We\u2019ll apply the discount after we verify everything.\n\n**For students:** Right after you sign up, [email us](mailto:students@basecamp.com) from your school account with the name of your school, what you\u2019re studying, and when you expect to graduate. We\u2019ll apply the discount after we verify everything.\n\n**Note:** We can only discount one account. If you need to support multiple groups, one account will give you everything you need to support them. If you\u2019ve been paying for Basecamp, we can\u2019t refund or discount payments made before your discount started. We reserve the right to end the discount program due to chronic abuse of the free accounts or other circumstances. If we do, anyone who is already participating will continue to have their discounts applied. We just won\u2019t offer up new free or discounted accounts.\n\nCould we really add 1000 users and still just pay $299/month total on Pro Unlimited?\n\n**Yes.** Basecamp is one of the few products in the entire industry with an all-inclusive, unlimited users package for one fixed, capped price. We pioneered this all-in package, and have been offering it for over a decade.\n\nIf we have clients, or work with contractors, do we have to pay for them too?\n\n**No.** Clients and contractors can be added to your account for free. On the Plus package, we only bill you $15/user/month for employees or full users, not clients or temporary contractors.\n\nDo I need a credit card to try Basecamp?\n\n**Nope.** We don\u2019t require a credit card on the Free account, or for any of the free trials. If you choose a pay package with a free trial, you\u2019ll be asked to enter your credit card at the end of your trial if you want to continue. It\u2019s entirely up to you.\n\nWill I automatically be charged when my 30 or 60-day free trial is up?\n\n**No.** We don\u2019t ask for a credit card to try Basecamp, so we couldn\u2019t charge you even if we wanted to. If you want to continue once your trial is up, then you\u2019d enter your credit card. You\u2019re in complete control.\n\nHow do upgrades work? What\u2019s included with Timesheet or the Admin Pro Pack?\n\nWhile Timesheet and Admin Pro Pack are included on the Pro Unlimited package, customers on the Plus package can optionally upgrade to either or both whenever they\u2019d like.\n\n**Timesheet** allows you to track time spent on tasks, writing, meetings, or other pieces of work within a Basecamp project. You can then run reports to aggregate time spent across projects, or per-person, to help with resource allocation or client billing. You can also export the data to bring into an accounting or billing system of your choice. The Timesheet upgrade is $50/month flat no matter how many people you have on your account. [this video shows you how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdazpMjeteE).\n\n**Admin Pro Pack** gives account owners and admins greater control over access and permissions and allows them to:\n\n*   Change who can send Pings (per company)\n*   Change who can edit project details\n*   Change who can edit people on a project\n*   Change who can move, archive, and delete content\n*   Change who can turn on public links\n*   Limit editing and deleting comments & chat lines to 15 minutes after posting\n*   Require two-factor authentication\n*   Change chat history settings\n*   Set Out of Office for others\n\nThe Admin Pro Pack upgrade is $50/month flat no matter how many people you have on your account. You can [learn more about Admin Pro Pack here](https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/687-admin-pro-pack).\n\nCan we buy more storage if we need it? How much is it?\n\n**Yes.** You can add an additional 1 terabyte (that\u2019s 1000 gigabytes) of storage for $50/month flat. The storage can be used by all users across your entire account.\n\nOn the free one project package, can I delete the project and start another one?\n\n**Yes.** You can only run one project at time on the Free package, but if you complete a project, or just want to get rid of the one you\u2019re currently running, you can delete it and free up the slot to start a new one. You can\u2019t, however, keep more than one around. So in order to start a new one, you must delete the current one.\n\nFor over 20 years, teams and companies have invested in themselves by implementing Basecamp for project management. You\u2019re in good company.",
