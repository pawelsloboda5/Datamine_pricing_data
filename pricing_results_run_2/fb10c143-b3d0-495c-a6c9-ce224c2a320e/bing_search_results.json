A record? Or a database?   \n \n \nWe know some of the terms may be unfamiliar. We have some more info here on some of the common database terms.    \n \n \n \nDo you charge by the user?   \n \n \nNo, there is no limit on users who can optionally log in and access your app. Each user just counts as a record stored in your database.    \n \n \n \nDo you have setup fees or contracts?   \n \n \nNope, there are no fees or contracts with Knack. Create your trial account in seconds without entering a credit card. At the end of your trial you can select a plan and pay month-to-month.    \n \n \n \nCan I use my own domain name?   \n \n \nAbsolutely! You can publish your app to your own website by using the embed features. Knack also provides a domain at knack.com for you to use.    \n \n \n \nCan I change plans or cancel?   \n \n \nOn monthly plans, you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your account at any time. Any upgrades or downgrades are automatically pro-rated for the next month. \nOn annual plans, you cannot downgrade plans or change to monthly until your renewal date. Our annual plans offer deep savings of two free months which is 17% off the monthly subscription price.    \n \n \n \nWhat kind of performance can I expect?   \n \n \nOur plans are designed to be very responsive in almost all use cases. Because these plans do share cloud resources, it is possible that performance can be affected by heavy bandwidth or processing usage. Please inquire about our enterprise plans if you have performance concerns or need dedicated resources.    \n \n \n \nWhat types of payment do you accept?   \n \n \nWe accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, and Diners Club cards) on our website. We do not accept checks, PayPal, or bank transfers. \n     \n \n \n \nWho owns the data stored in my app?   \n \n \nYou own it! Although the data is stored in Knack databases, you are the complete owner of your data and are solely responsible for its contents.        \n \n \n \nJoin the thousands of customers that trust Knack today  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n          \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n    \n\nThe best no-code platform for building custom online databases and applications.  \n               \n \n \nPLATFORM \n\n\nData Management \nE-commerce \nInterface \nIntegrations \nReports \nSecurity \nUser Access \nWorkflow   \n \nSOLUTIONS \n\n\nConstruction \nEducation \nGovernment \nHealthcare \nMedia \nNon-Profit   \n \nUSE CASES \n\n\nCustom CRM \nCustomer Portal \nEvent Management \nGrants Management \nInventory Management \nOnline Database \nProject Management   \n \nRESOURCES \n\n\nAffiliates \nBlog \nCase Studies \nHire an Expert \nLearning Center \nSpreadsheet Templates \nTemplate Apps \nVideos   \n \nSUPPORT \n\n\nAbout \nCareers \nContact \nCommunity Forum \nDeveloper Docs    \n    \n                \n \n Terms of Service | Privacy Policy | \n Copyright. \u00a9 Knack 2025 all rights reserved    \n \n Terms of Service | Privacy Policy \n Copyright. \u00a9 Knack 2025 all rights reserved      \n \n    \n \n \nDecline \n \n \n We use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve your experience.

A record? Or a database?   \n \n \nWe know some of the terms may be unfamiliar. We have some more info here on some of the common database terms.    \n \n \n \nDo you charge by the user?   \n \n \nNo, there is no limit on users who can optionally log in and access your app. Each user just counts as a record stored in your database.    \n \n \n \nDo you have setup fees or contracts?   \n \n \nNope, there are no fees or contracts with Knack. Create your trial account in seconds without entering a credit card. At the end of your trial you can select a plan and pay month-to-month.    \n \n \n \nCan I use my own domain name?   \n \n \nAbsolutely! You can publish your app to your own website by using the embed features. Knack also provides a domain at knack.com for you to use.    \n \n \n \nCan I change plans or cancel?   \n \n \nOn monthly plans, you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your account at any time. Any upgrades or downgrades are automatically pro-rated for the next month. \nOn annual plans, you cannot downgrade plans or change to monthly until your renewal date. Our annual plans offer deep savings of two free months which is 17% off the monthly subscription price.    \n \n \n \nWhat kind of performance can I expect?   \n \n \nOur plans are designed to be very responsive in almost all use cases. Because these plans do share cloud resources, it is possible that performance can be affected by heavy bandwidth or processing usage. Please inquire about our enterprise plans if you have performance concerns or need dedicated resources.    \n \n \n \nWhat types of payment do you accept?   \n \n \nWe accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, and Diners Club cards) on our website. We do not accept checks, PayPal, or bank transfers. \n     \n \n \n \nWho owns the data stored in my app?   \n \n \nYou own it! Although the data is stored in Knack databases, you are the complete owner of your data and are solely responsible for its contents.        \n \n \n \nJoin the thousands of customers that trust Knack today  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n          \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n    \n\nThe best no-code platform for building custom online databases and applications.  \n               \n \n \nPLATFORM \n\n\nData Management \nE-commerce \nInterface \nIntegrations \nReports \nSecurity \nUser Access \nWorkflow   \n \nSOLUTIONS \n\n\nConstruction \nEducation \nGovernment \nHealthcare \nMedia \nNon-Profit   \n \nUSE CASES \n\n\nCustom CRM \nCustomer Portal \nEvent Management \nGrants Management \nInventory Management \nOnline Database \nProject Management   \n \nRESOURCES \n\n\nAffiliates \nBlog \nCase Studies \nHire an Expert \nLearning Center \nSpreadsheet Templates \nTemplate Apps \nVideos   \n \nSUPPORT \n\n\nAbout \nCareers \nContact \nCommunity Forum \nDeveloper Docs    \n    \n                \n \n Terms of Service | Privacy Policy | \n Copyright. \u00a9 Knack 2025 all rights reserved    \n \n Terms of Service | Privacy Policy \n Copyright. \u00a9 Knack 2025 all rights reserved      \n \n    \n \n \nDecline \n \n \n We use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve your experience.
