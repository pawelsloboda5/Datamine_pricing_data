GymMaster worked with me non stop prior to opening my doors to ensure a great opening day. Even better, they are always available when I need anything. The support is great! I'm sure very simple person and the software is very very very user friendly. Thanks again!! Keep up the great work!\u201d\n\nJoe | Joe's Gym | Iowa, USA\n\n\u201cGymMaster has been the most user friendly software I have ever used! The layout and style is attractive, the customer support outstanding and I have never had any issue with the hardware. Would highly recommend GymMaster to anyone looking to upgrade!\u201d\n\nRachel Scott | Four Peak Fitness | Geraldine, New Zealand\n\n\u201c\u201cWe have been in business for 10 years now and with your gym software system we just installed in November 2016 we will be able to compete with the bigger franchises that are all open 24/7. Plus we can reduce the cost of staffing as that is one of our huge costs as the facility had to have a attendant at all hours.\u201d\n\nJordan | Sets Fitness | Saskatchewan, Canada\n\n\u201cI really appreciate the professionalism of GymMaster. It is obvious that you guys have been in the business for a long time and know what you are talking about. I also really like how quickly the hardware was shipped to us in Canada. It was shipped on Tuesday and on Friday morning we received it.\u201d\n\nMagali Dantier | Fitness Expert | BC, Canada\n\n\u201cOur favorite thing is how easy it is to communicate with the GymMaster staff and how quickly problems are resolved!\u201d\n\nTaylor Johnson | Man O' War CrossFit | Kentucky, USA\n\n\u201cI carefully considered several companies before choosing GymMaster. GymMaster is by far the most comprehensive software I have been able to find. From billing all the way to the locks, it\u2019s all streamlined. Also, customer support is second to none. I have never called in a tight spot and not had immediate help.\u201d\n\nZak Huffman | Warrior Fitness Facility | Ohio, USA\n\n\u201cWhere do I start? The support from the staff is fantastic whenever an issue arises. The system and software is so easy to use and it makes sign ups and managing members a breeze. Finally the pricing structure is far fairer than competitors. So glad I went with GymMaster.\u201d\n\nMatthew Sprigg | Flex Fitness Club | Australia\n\n\u201cI've had my gym open for 4 months now.
