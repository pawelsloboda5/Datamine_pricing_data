choice, which allows you to test all features of that plan with no restrictions. In order to access your data and continue using Paymo after 15 days, you'll have to create a monthly or yearly subscription.\n\nDo I need a credit card to sign up?\n\n+\n\nNo. You'll only need it after the trial expires or when you decide that Paymo is the right solution for you and start a monthly or yearly subscription.\n\nWhat if I want to add more users to our plan in the future?\n\n+\n\nYou can upgrade the number of users on your plan at any time. It's really easy \u2013 just head to Subscription and Billing and click on Change Subscription.\n\nCan I cancel my subscription at any time?\n\n+\n\nYes. Even if we hope that it won't be necessary, you can cancel your subscription whenever you believe that Paymo is no longer helping you with your business.\n\nCan I pay yearly instead of monthly?\n\n+\n\nYes, you can pay once for a yearly subscription; this way, you can receive a discount of up to 40% (depending on the plan you choose). There are no cancellations or other hidden fees.\n\nWhat types of payment do you accept?\n\n+\n\nWe are currently accepting Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express credit cards.\n\nWhat's a \"user\"?\n\n+\n\nA user (aka a seat) is a person in your company or from outside who's able to log in to your company account and uses all or some of the features of the app (depending on their administrative rights).\n\nWill my data be private and safe?\n\n+\n\nAbsolutely! All your records are private, therefore only you can view and use them.\n\n![Image 10: Quote testimonial](https://www.paymoapp.com/pricing)Paymo allows our small business to focus on our business, not our paperwork. Tracking our time, creating estimates and invoices is made simple using this app. We use it every day.\n\n![Image 11: Image Danielle Bushore](https://www.paymoapp.com/pricing)\n\n#### Danielle Bushore\n\n[Nine Sixteen Creative INC](http://www.ninesixteen.ca/)\n\n![Image 12: Quote testimonial](https://www.paymoapp.com/pricing)The team is more focused on every project, since they are rarely interrupted by missed tasks that need urgent attention. I can estimate a 25-30% increase in productivity and maybe, more importantly, a decrease in the overall stress level.\n\n![Image 13: Image Cristian Stoicescu](https://www.paymoapp.com/pricing)\n\n####
