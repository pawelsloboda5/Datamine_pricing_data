What\u2019s the difference?\n\nAre you looking for a personal to do list with unlimited tasks, subtasks and Grocery Lists? Then the basic (free) version is just what you need. Do you want to power up your productivity with advanced features such as our Zapier Integration, Location Reminders, Custom Backgrounds and Themes and more? Then the Premium plan is just up your alley. Looking to plan out your family\u2019s agenda, after-school activities, shopping lists and more? Share your household projects, todo lists and calendars with our designated Family plan! Lastly, if you\u2019re looking for advanced project management and collaboration then Any.do Teams is your perfect solution. Still not sure? Reach out to our [Customer Success Team](https://www.any.do/contact_form) for assistance.\n\nCan I use Any.do for free?\n\nYou sure can. Any.do offers a free version for personal users looking to manage their tasks through private to-do lists. We also offer FREE trial periods for our Premium and Teams plans, so users can fully enjoy the benefits of our advanced features before committing to a paid plan.\n\nWhat is an Any.do Workspace?\n\nAny.do Workspace is a team collaboration platform that empowers individuals. It's an all-encompassing platform that enables teams to streamline their work, collaborate successfully, and manage both personal and professional projects simultaneously. To start a free trial with Any.do Teams and experience everything Workspace has to offer, [click here](https://app.any.do/?website_registration_flow=team).\n\nI want to share tasks with other users. Which plan should I choose?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to share items with your partner/household then our Family plan is just right for you! But if you\u2019re looking for more advanced collaborative features for large team and/or project management options, then our Workspace plan is best! You can find more details about our plans [here](https://support.any.do/en/articles/8635977-any-do-subscription-plans) or contact our [Success Team](https://www.any.do/contact_form) if you have any specific questions.\n\nI\u2019m a single user, do I need to purchase a plan?\n\nNot at all! You can use Any.do Personal entirely for free for as much and as long as you like. But if you want to get access to the Workspace and boards or need some advanced features like location reminders, integrations like Whatsapp and Zapoer, advanced recurring reminders an others, we recommend checking our [subscription plans](https://support.any.do/en/articles/8635977-any-do-subscription-plans) for added productivity \ud83d\ude42\n\nHow can my team try out Any.do Workspace for free?\n\nEasy! Take advantage of our full 14 days trial of Any.do Teams [by clicking right here](https://app.any.do/?website_registration_flow=team).

There\u2019s no limit to how many members can be added to your workspace \ud83d\ude42\n\nHow can I control who has access to my boards and what my team can see?\n\nWorkspace admins and board admins have total control over shared items! With our quick and easy [permission-settings](https://support.any.do/en/articles/8614000-user-roles-and-permissions), you can control who can access what and even choose to create entirely [private boards](https://support.any.do/en/articles/8634483-creating-boards#h_c67b20f1e6) for your eyes only!\n\nDo I need to pay for all members in my workspace (Team)?\n\nYes. All members added to your workspace will be part of the Workspace Admin\u2019s subscription plan. These members will have full access to the workspace, boards and all upgraded Teams and Premium features. However, if you want to share boards in read-only mode you can do so with [external links](https://support.any.do/en/articles/8614049-working-with-external-viewers) for no additional cost!\n\nCan I add more members to my family plan? Do I pay for each member?\n\nThe family plan already includes all members so there\u2019s no additional cost! The number of members in the family plan is fixed though and you cannot add more members to this plan (for more members, we recommend checking out the [Teams](https://support.any.do/en/articles/8635977-any-do-subscription-plans?q=external+#h_9457a7a4f2) plan instead).\n\nDo all members in my Teams/ Family plan get access to the paid features?\n\nYes! Each member will have the same access to the upgraded features such as [Whatsapp](https://support.any.do/en/articles/8616832-any-do-whatsapp-reminders-tasks), [Any.do\u2019s AI features](https://support.any.do/en/articles/8637385-any-do-ai), [Third Party Imports](https://support.any.do/en/articles/8634373-third-party-workspace-imports) and more.\n\nI want to remove a Teams/Family member. How will it affect my billing?\n\nIf you want to remove an inactive member you can easily do so straight from your account. Any member you remove from your plan can be switched with a new member for the same seat \ud83d\ude42 Just make sure to remove the member before adding a new one!\n\nDo you offer discounts?\n\nWe sure do! If you\u2019re a student, an educator or working for a NGO, reach out to our [Customer Success Team](https://www.any.do/contact_form) for a discounted Premium offer today.\n\nWhat payment methods are available?\n\nAny.do offers various payment options for the convenience of our users.
