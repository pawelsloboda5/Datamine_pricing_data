While Podio is a collaborative tool, sometimes work is confidential and should not be seen by everyone in an organization. A private workspace is invite only \u2013 users that are not a member of the workspace cannot access it or even see that it exists.\n\n#### [What are automated workflows?](https://www.podio.com/site/pricing/#1067240601-2967666217-2)\n\nYou can use workflows to automate your processes in Podio. Workflows are triggered using a \"when/then\" format. For example, you can set up a workflow that functions like this: when you change the status of an item to \"complete\", then a task is automatically assigned to the person who needs to review the item. [Find out more](https://docs.sharefile.com/en-us/podio/using-podio/using-apps/automating-workflows.html)\n\n#### [How many items can I create in an app?](https://www.podio.com/site/pricing/#1067240601-2967666217-3)\n\nYou get to create unlimited items in any of the paid plans. On the free plan, you have a limit of 100 items per organisation. This limit on item count is at an organisation level, so the total items created across all your apps and workspaces in the organisation should not exceed 100. You could either have a single app in the organisation with 100 items or have multiple apps that all combined do not exceed the 100 limit. [Learn more](https://docs.sharefile.com/en-us/podio/using-podio/upgrade-and-billing/free-version-features.html) about the Item Limit.\n\nNot sure what an item, app or workspace is? [Find out more](https://docs.sharefile.com/en-us/podio/getting-started/knowing-podio/podio-structure.html)\n\n#### [How is an annual plan different from a month-to-month plan?](https://www.podio.com/site/pricing/#1067240601-2967666217-4)\n\nOn a Premium annual plan, you have access to Podio's advanced integrations, like extension vouchers and sales dashboards from our partners. Using the annual plan you will pay for 1 year up front and receive a discount. Your plan will automatically renew at the next annual billing cycle.\n\n#### [What is the difference between an employee and a client?](https://www.podio.com/site/pricing/#1067240601-2967666217-5)\n\nEmployees are identified based on their permission they pay. For all plans, you pay for each employee, but all the clients (contractors, freelancers, etc.) are free. Read more about the permissions [here](https://docs.sharefile.com/en-us/podio/using-podio/managing-members/member-roles-in-workspaces.html). Paid employee users have access to advanced collaboration in workspaces, and the ability to create and manage apps and workflows. Free client users can participate in workspaces, read, add comments, and upload files.\n\n#### [What is user management?](https://www.podio.com/site/pricing/#1067240601-2967666217-6)\n\nUser management gives administrators control over members in your organization. This includes an overview of all members from the entire organization and provides a seamless way to convert a client to employee and vice versa. [Find out more](https://docs.sharefile.com/en-us/podio/using-podio/managing-members/user-management.html)\n\n#### [What is the light user role?](https://www.podio.com/site/pricing/#1067240601-2967666217-7)\n\nPodio allows you to collaborate with external users like clients, partners, and freelancers. The light role limits what these users can do. Light users can't edit, add, or delete apps, nor can they invite people to your workspaces. [Find out more](https://docs.sharefile.com/en-us/podio/using-podio/managing-members/member-roles-in-workspaces.html)\n\n#### [What if I need custom integrations?](https://www.podio.com/site/pricing/#1067240601-2967666217-8)\n\nWe have partners available to assist with custom integrations, implementation and training for your team worldwide.
