Questions\n--------------------------\n\nHow much would it cost me if I have more than 30 users?\n\nConnecteam offers a fixed price for up to 30 users, meaning you can start with 1 and grow your team up to 30 users without paying a single extra penny!\n\nOnce reaching 30 users, we have affordable prices per user per month. Here\u2019s the price breakdown:\n\n**Basic / Yearly:** $0.5 per month for each additional user\n\n**Basic / Monthly:** $0.6 per month for each additional user\n\n**Advanced / Yearly:** $1.5 per month for each additional user\n\n**Advanced / Monthly:** $1.8 per month for each additional user\n\n**Expert / Yearly:** $3 per month for each additional user\n\n**Expert / Monthly:** $3.6 per month for each additional user\n\nDo I have to pay for it?\n\nWell, no! If you\u2019re a small business with less than 10 employees, you can use the \u201cSmall Business Plan\u201d which is cost-free and includes everything a small business needs!  \nIf your team is larger than 10 employees but less than 30, after the 14-day trial, you can select the Limited plan option that exists for all Hubs. The Limited plan is free for life and it includes the essentials of each product we offer. That said, our prices are extremely competitive, and no other platform in this class offers so many capabilities for such an affordable fixed price for the first 30 employees! So whether it\u2019s your need to improve communication, save time and money on manual procedures, or just keep everyone on the same page \u2013 you can do it all and much more with an app that is highly customizable for your business. Totally worth it, right?\n\nIn what currency is your pricing?\n\nAll prices on our website and product are in USD only at the moment.\n\nDo I have to do the 14-day trial?\n\nIn a word \u2013 yes \ud83d\ude42 Everyone gets started with the free 14-day trial, which includes everything Connecteam has to offer, so you can truly experience the product with no limitations. By the end of the free trial, you can choose whether you subscribe to a premium plan or use the Limited plan for an unlimited time with up to 30 users. Bear in mind that the Limited plan doesn\u2019t include everything you experienced during your free trial, which means some capabilities will be lost. If you\u2019re a small business with less than 10 employees, you\u2019ll be able to use the Small Business Plan, which is free for life but includes everything a small business need with barely any limitations \ud83d\ude42\n\nHow does the free 14-day trial work?\n\nFor 14 days, you can use Connecteam\u2019s unlimited capabilities, completely free (you\u2019ll experience the Expert plan). No credit card needed, no strings attached. During those 14 days, our Customer Success Team will help you understand if Connecteam is the right solution for your business.\n\nWhat happens when my free trial is over?\n\nAfter a free 14-day trial, you need to decide if you will continue using Connecteam. If you do, you need to subscribe to one of our premium plans or use the Limited plan (cost-free) for up to 30 users. We try to make this decision as easy as possible, that\u2019s why we offer a monthly subscription that can be canceled at any time (no refunds will be granted for any pre-paid amounts), and an annual subscription that includes a prorated refund if canceled within the first 30 days.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to subscribe, all your information will stay intangible until you decide to subscribe or delete the account upon request.\n\nIf you\u2019re a small business with less than 10 employees, you\u2019ll be able to use the \u201cSmall Business Plan\u201d for free \ud83d\ude42\n\nHow does the Breadcrumbs (live tracking) option work? Does it follow my employees 24/7?\n\nWhen enabled, the Breadcrumbs option will track users\u2019 location only while they\u2019re on the clock. When they\u2019re off the clock, their location won\u2019t be documented or processed by Connecteam.\n\nConnecteam uses the native capabilities of modern smartphones to ensure the best user experience for your team and allows them to have the app completely closed in the background when tracking time, which helps with battery life, cellular data consumption, and creates a seamless, no-brainer experience.\n\nOn another note, it means they\u2019ll need to enable their location services for the app to \u201cAlways\u201d so their location can be tracked without the need to keep the app open or running. While it states that their location is always being tracked according to the device, Connecteam will NEVER process or document users\u2019 location when they\u2019re off the clock.\n\nWhat does \"number of time clocks / schedules\" mean?\n\nOn the Operations Hub \\> Advanced plan and above you can add more than a single time clock / schedule to your account. It usually being used by companies with multiple branches or locations that want each branch to have different users, admins, activated settings options, and more. If you\u2019re not sure which option is best for you, simply contact our team and we\u2019ll be happy to help!\n\nHow does your pricing work?\n\nWe have 3 Hubs, each with different plans, ranging from Basic all the way to Enterprise. That way, you can enjoy Connecteam\u2019s all-in-one experience while only paying for what you actually need. Our prices are fixed for the first 30 users, and from the 31st user and above we have a price per user, per month, for each plan.\n\nFor example, an SMB can subscribe to the Expert plan on the Operations Hub, the Advanced plan on the Communications Hub, and the Basic plan on the HR & Skills Hub; a very small business can decide to go Free on all Hubs, and large company with 500 employees would probably go Enterprise on all Hubs to save costs and make the most of the platform.\n\nIt\u2019s really up to you and it\u2019s really that flexible! And if you\u2019re not sure, simply ask us! We\u2019ll be happy to recommend the best bundle for your business needs \ud83d\ude42\n\nA couple of important notes:\n\n*   The Enterprise plan is mostly recommended for companies with 201-10,000 employees. Contact our team for more information about the Enterprise plan in each Hub.\n*   Small businesses with less than 10 employees can use the \u201cSmall Business Plan\u201d which is a robust package with everything a small business needs, entirely free!\n\nHow does 2 free months work for the annual subscription?\n\nWhen purchasing a plan on an annual subscription, your monthly cost is reduced in a way that equals to 10 months of use on a monthly subscription. And there you go \u2013 2 months for free \ud83d\ude42\n\nAfter purchase, can I change plans?\n\nYes. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time.\n\nWe offer a monthly subscription that can be canceled at any time (no refunds will be granted for any pre-paid amounts), and an annual subscription that includes a prorated refund if canceled within the first 30 days.\n\nWhat happens if I want to add more seats to my account during my payment period?\n\nIf you decide to add additional seats to your account during your current payment cycle, whether it\u2019s monthly or annually, we\u2019ve got you covered with a pro-rated payment system. This means you only pay for the new seats for the remaining portion of your current billing cycle. We calculate this amount by dividing the cost of the seat by the number of days in the cycle and multiplying it by the number of days remaining. This ensures that you\u2019re only charged for what you use, keeping the process fair and transparent. When your next billing cycle begins, the full cost of the additional seats will be included in the total payment.\n\n**Example:** You want to add a seat (i.e. a 3$ cost) to your account in the middle of the month and you\u2019re on a monthly subscription.\n\nYou will pay 1.5$ right now for the current payment cycle. The following payment cycle will contain the full 3$ seat payment.\n\nConnecteam offers fixed price, affordable plans for any business! Visit our pricing page for more details.",
