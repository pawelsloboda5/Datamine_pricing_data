The price of each plan is determined by\u00a0available features and number of agents. Textline\u2019s subscription plans do not include messaging costs or industry regulation fees. Let\u2019s look at how to determine your costs:\n\n1.\n\n**Pick your plan.** Choose from Limited, Standard, Pro, and Enterprise. Pay by month or annually upfront. Annual plans receive a discount. [Contact sales](https://www.textline.com/contact-us) for more information on annual plans.\n\n2.\n\n**Purchase bulk message credits.** Determine how many messages you\u2019ll send and receive per month. Then, buy the bulk message credit amount that works best for your business. The default messaging package includes a required minimum of 500 credits ($15). Unused credits will roll over.\n\n3.\n\n**Plan your add-ons.** You can purchase additional features like Webchat or add agents.\n\n#### What if I don\u2019t know what plan to choose?\n\nYou can do several things. First, you can [contact us here](https://www.textline.com/contact-us), and we can help guide you in the right direction. Or, you can [test out a plan](https://application.textline.com/auth/sign_up) you think is the best fit for free. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.\n\n#### Do you charge for messaging?\n\nYes. We offer bulk message credits. The default messaging package includes 500 credits. Learn the ins and outs in [this article](https://www.textline.com/messaging-cost).\n\n#### What happens if I don\u2019t use all bulk message credits?\n\nDon\u2019t worry! Any unused credits will roll over to the next month for you to use.\n\n#### What happens if I go over my bulk message limit?\n\nIf you exceed your message amount per month, your account will use up backup credits. These credits cost $.04 and roll over like monthly credits. Every account is required to have a minimum of 250 backup credits. These credits are not charged until you surpass your designated threshold.\n\n#### What is one message credit worth?\n\nOne message credit equates to one SMS segment or a 160-character standard text message. MMS messages are three message credits on Textline. [View message credit details here.](https://www.textline.com/messaging-cost)\n\n#### How do you handle phone number registration costs?\n\nYou can choose to set up a [toll-free number or a 10-digit long code](https://www.textline.com/blog/types-of-phone-numbers) on Textline. 10DLC numbers register with [The Campaign Registry](https://www.textline.com/blog/the-campaign-registry-explained-how-to-register-forms-you-need-faqs). You\u2019ll see a [$15 campaign fee](https://help.textline.com/en/articles/6660222-the-campaign-registry-pricing) on your bill each month if you use a 10DLC. At this time, toll-free numbers do not have a monthly registration fee.\n\n#### Can I use my own number with Textline?\n\nYes. In most cases, you can use your own number with Textline. Please contact our customer service number at 415-849-4349 or email us to check if we can text-enable your number. We can text-enable most landlines, but cell phone numbers ported to Textline will lose voice functionality and the ability to text from the phone\u2019s native texting app.\n\n#### Can I call people using my Textline number?\n\nWe don\u2019t provide voice functionality for our Textline numbers; however, we can set up call forwarding for it. Read more about forwarding calls in [this article](https://help.textline.com/en/articles/6660439-tutorial-forwarding-calls).\n\n#### Can I try Textline before paying?\n\nAbsolutely.

The price of each plan is determined by\u00a0\u00a0available features and number of agents. Textline\u2019s subscription plans do not include messaging costs or industry regulation fees. Let\u2019s look at how to determine your costs:\n\n1.\n\n**Pick your plan.** Choose from Limited, Standard, Pro, and Enterprise. Pay by month or annually upfront. Annual plans receive a discount. [Contact sales](https://www.textline.com/contact-us) for more information on annual plans.\n\n2.\n\n**Purchase bulk message credits.** Determine how many messages you\u2019ll send and receive per month. Then, buy the bulk message credit amount that works best for your business. The default messaging package includes a required minimum of 500 credits ($15). Unused credits will roll over.\n\n3.\n\n**Plan your add-ons.** You can purchase additional features like Webchat or add more agents.\n\n#### Do you charge for messaging?\n\nYes. We offer bulk message credits. The default messaging package includes 500 credits. Learn the ins and outs in [this article](https://www.textline.com/messaging-cost).\n\n#### What happens if I don\u2019t use all bulk message credits?\n\nDon\u2019t worry! Any unused credits will roll over to the next month for you to use.\n\n#### What happens if I go over my bulk message limit?\n\nIf you exceed your message amount per month, your account will use up backup credits. These credits cost $.04 and roll over like monthly credits. Every account is required to have a minimum of 250 backup credits. These credits are not charged until you surpass your designated threshold.\n\n#### What is one message credit worth?\n\nOne message credit equates to one SMS segment or a 160-character standard text message. MMS messages are three message credits on Textline. View message credit details [here](https://www.textline.com/messaging-cost).\n\n#### How do you handle phone number registration costs?\n\nYou can choose to set up a [toll-free number or a 10-digit long code](https://www.textline.com/blog/types-of-phone-numbers) on Textline. 10DLC numbers register with [The Campaign Registry](https://www.textline.com/blog/the-campaign-registry-explained-how-to-register-forms-you-need-faqs). You\u2019ll see a [$15 campaign fee](https://help.textline.com/en/articles/6660222-the-campaign-registry-pricing) on your bill each month if you use a 10DLC. At this time, toll-free numbers do not have a monthly registration fee.\n\n#### Can I use my own number with Textline?\n\nYes. In most cases, you can use your own number with Textline. Please contact our customer service number at +1 415-849-4349 or email us to check if we can text-enable your number. We can text-enable most landlines, but cell phone numbers ported to Textline will lose voice functionality and the ability to text from the phone\u2019s native texting app.\n\n#### Can I call people using my Textline number?\n\nWe don\u2019t provide voice functionality for our Textline numbers; however, we can set up call forwarding for it. Read more about forwarding calls in [this article](https://help.textline.com/en/articles/6660439-tutorial-forwarding-calls).\n\n#### Can I try Textline before paying?\n\nAbsolutely.
