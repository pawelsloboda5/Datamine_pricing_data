Please note that some features are not available in the free trial, including AI connectors `BETA`, autofilling a database in bulk, and auto-updating of autofilled database properties.\n\nThe number of complimentary AI responses is shared among the entire workspace. Once you've used all your complimentary AI responses, you will see a message that a Notion AI add-on subscription is necessary to continue using AI features. You\u2019ll need to be a workspace owner, and on desktop, to add Notion AI to your plan.\n\nHow does Notion AI use my data?\n\nWe follow our standard [data protection practices](https://notion.so/security) to keep your data encrypted and private. Notion AI will not use your data to train our models unless you opt in to a request to share your data.\n\nAny information used to power Notion AI will be shared with AI subprocessors for the sole purpose of providing you with the Notion AI features. We specifically have contractual agreements in place with our AI subprocessors that prohibit the use of customer data to train their models. [Learn more about Notion AI security and privacy practices here](https://www.notion.so/help/notion-ai-security-practices).\n\nCan I purchase Notion AI for only part of my team, without purchasing for the entire workspace?\n\nNotion AI can only be purchased for the entire workspace. Currently, there isn\u2019t an option to provision AI access to only a portion of your workspace.\n\nIf you do decide to add AI to your workspace, every member in the workspace will be able to use AI features \u2014 this includes workspace owners, membership admins, and members. Guests will not be able to use AI features in your workspace.\n\nHow do I get charged when I add members to my workspace?\n\nWhen you add a new member to your workspace, they will use an existing paid seat if you have any available in your workspace. If you do not have any existing available paid seats, your count of paid seats will increase by 1. Changes in membership that occur mid-month will create prorated charges based on the amount of time remaining in the billing cycle when the paid seat was added.\n\nFor every member you delete from your workspace, you will open up 1 available paid seat. This means you have the option to exchange members in your workspace without paying any additional costs, as long as your total billable seat count remains the same.\n\nYou\u2019ll receive an invoice for any charges accrued by changes in membership on your selected payment method, on the day of the month you initially signed up for your subscription.\n\nEach time your billing period starts (monthly or annual), your count of paid seats will be synchronized so it exactly matches the amount of members present in your workspace.\n\nWhere can I find my invoices?\n\nWorkspace admins can access, view, and download your workspace's invoices by going to `Settings & members` \u2192 `Billing`, then scrolling to `Invoices`. There you can click on \"View invoice\" to see the invoice PDF.\n\nWhat are your accepted payment methods?\n\nWe currently accept all major credit and debit card brands.\n\nWhat happens when I go over the block storage limit on a Free Plan?\n\nIf you\u2019re using a Free Plan workspace by yourself, you\u2019ll be able to add as many pages and blocks as you like.\n\nIf you\u2019re using a Free Plan workspace with multiple members, you\u2019ll be able to add a limited number of blocks before you have to upgrade.\n\nWhen you reach the limit, you can still read, edit, and organize existing content blocks as usual, but you won\u2019t be able to add new content blocks.\n\nWhat is a block?\n\nA block is any single piece of content you add to your page, like a paragraph of text, a to-do item, an image, a code block, an embedded file, etc. Think of your page as being made up of these building blocks. Learn more about blocks [here \u2192](https://www.notion.com/help/what-is-a-block)\n\nDo you offer student discounts?\n\nThe Plus Plan (with a 1-member limit) is free for students and educators. Compared to the Free Plan, you\u2019ll be able to add more guests, have access to more version history, and upload larger files.\n\nJust sign up with your school email address and you\u2019ll immediately gain access to these features. Thousands of school email domains are eligible, not just .edu!\n\nHow is pricing calculated for the paid plans?\n\nIf you upgrade your workspace to one of the paid plans, you will be charged a fee per member.\n\nGuests are free of charge \u2013 but they can only access individual pages they are invited to. In other words, guests won\u2019t be able to see all the team pages under the `Teamspaces` section in the left sidebar.\n\nWhat do the different analytics tiers mean?\n\n**Basic page analytics (Free and Plus Plans):** Includes a list of page viewers as well as a chart displaying views over time.\n\n**Advanced page analytics** **(Business Plan):** Includes everything above as well as a list of page editors.\n\n**Workspace analytics (Enterprise Plan):** Includes everything above as well as user level analytics, analytics on all pages in your workspace, and search analytics for content in your workspace.\n\nHow does adding and removing members work?\n\nWhether you're on a monthly or yearly billing schedule, your account may be charged on a monthly basis if you make changes in membership. If you added members, your account will be charged a prorated amount based on the percentage of the billing cycle left when a user was added. If you removed members, you will not receive credit but instead will still have use of that seat for a different user for the remainder of the billing period.\n\nWhat happens when I change plans?\n\n*   **Upgrading your plan:** Your account will be upgraded and charged immediately. The amount due will be reduced based on the percentage of the billing cycle left at the time the plan was changed.\n    \n*   **Downgrading your plan:** Your account will be downgraded at the end of your billing cycle. Learn about how your features may be impacted after a downgrade [here \u2192](https://notion.com/help/plan-downgrade)\n    \n\nHow do I cancel my paid plan?\n\nYour Notion subscription, annual or monthly, will automatically renew until you cancel it. You can cancel your subscription by going to `Settings` in the left-hand sidebar on a desktop computer, then selecting `Billing`, then `Change plan`. After you cancel, you\u2019ll still have access to all the paid features until the end of your billing cycle.\n\nLearn more about billing in [this article](https://www.notion.com/help/billing-and-payment-info).\n\nWhat happens if my payment fails? Like if my credit card expires?\n\nYour account email will be notified after each failed payment. Payments may be retried up to 8 times within the next month.\n\nAfter this, if the payment did not succeed, your workspace will get restricted to limited-access for a period of time before being downgraded to the Free plan.\n\nCan I change my payment method?\n\nYou can change your payment method at any time in your billing settings.\n\nHow do refunds work?\n\nOur refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or email [team@makenotion.com](mailto:team@makenotion.com). We'll be happy to refund you the full amount (not pro-rated) if you downgrade your subscription within three days of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.\n\nIf you have accidentally added members to your workspace, you can remove those members at any time. If you\u2019ve been charged for members who were accidentally added, we're happy to provide a refund of the prorated charges if you reach out within three days of the invoice date (please make sure the additional members have been removed from your workspace when writing in).\n\nAnd if for any reason you're unhappy with Notion, please let us know at [team@makenotion.com](mailto:team@makenotion.com) \u2014 we'd love to hear your feedback, and will be happy to work with you to create the best experience possible.\n\nWhat if I live in a region with a mandatory refund policy?\n\nIf you live in the European Union, United Kingdom, or another region with a mandatory refund policy, you may be eligible for a monthly subscription refund past 72 hours. For example, customers in the European Union can receive a full refund for a monthly subscription within 14 days of purchase, rather than 72 hours.\n\nTo request a refund, please contact us inside the app or email team@makenotion.com. If you live in a region with a mandatory refund policy, please let us know and we'll be happy to assist you.\n\n* * *\n\nLearn more about our different pricing plans.
