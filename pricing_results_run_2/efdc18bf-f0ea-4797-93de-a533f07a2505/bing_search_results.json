Your expenses dynamically align with your fundraising success, making this model perfect for both seasonal initiatives and continuous operations. Plus, there are no charges for monthly or annual subscriptions, and no contract is required!\n\n###### What are the fees to use Fundraise\u00a0Up?\n\nA 4% transaction fee and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca/pricing) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) fees are the only fees you\u2019ll have.\n\n###### Our nonprofit has chapters, can their account be linked to ours?\n\nYes, in fact you can share a bank account, have separate bank accounts or a combination of both.\n\n###### How does your platform distinguish itself from competitors?\n\nOur primary focus is enhancing your conversion rates and boosting your fundraising initiatives. Every feature we offer is backed by data to ensure it drives conversions. Enjoy unlimited access to all features and users, a straightforward flat-rate fee, and readily available customer support.\n\n###### Can you explain how transaction fees work?\n\nTransaction fees are the costs associated with processing payments. Through our partnership with Stripe, we ensure a seamless payment experience, with Stripe charging a minimal fee of 2.2% plus $0.30 per transaction. For example, if you get 5 donations a month of $10 each, the fees would be $2 to Fundraise\u00a0Up and $2.60 to Stripe.\n\n###### What methods are available for receiving donations?\n\nWe support a wide range of payment options, including credit and debit cards, Google Pay, Apple Pay, cryptocurrencies, iDEAL, and direct bank transfers, catering to a global donor base.

Your expenses dynamically align with your fundraising success, making this model perfect for both seasonal initiatives and continuous operations. Plus, there are no charges for monthly or annual subscriptions, and no contract is required!\n\n###### What are the fees to use Fundraise\u00a0Up?\n\nA 4% transaction fee and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca/pricing) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees) fees are the only fees you\u2019ll have.\n\n###### Our nonprofit has chapters, can their account be linked to ours?\n\nYes, in fact you can share a bank account, have separate bank accounts or a combination of both.\n\n###### How does your platform distinguish itself from competitors?\n\nOur primary focus is enhancing your conversion rates and boosting your fundraising initiatives. Every feature we offer is backed by data to ensure it drives conversions. Enjoy unlimited access to all features and users, a straightforward flat-rate fee, and readily available customer support.\n\n###### Can you explain how transaction fees work?\n\nTransaction fees are the costs associated with processing payments. Through our partnership with Stripe, we ensure a seamless payment experience, with Stripe charging a minimal fee of 2.2% plus $0.30 per transaction. For example, if you get 5 donations a month of $10 each, the fees would be $2 to Fundraise\u00a0Up and $2.60 to Stripe.\n\n###### What methods are available for receiving donations?\n\nWe support a wide range of payment options, including credit and debit cards, Google Pay, Apple Pay, cryptocurrencies, iDEAL, and direct bank transfers, catering to a global donor base.
