 \n\nFAQs\n----\n\nWe switched our billing metric from users to contacts for a few reasons:\n\n*   **It\u2019s more predictable**. We ran the numbers and found contact billing is 34% more predictable month-to-month than it was with users.\n    \n*   **Everyone is invited.** With unlimited users, you no longer have to worry about managing seats or siloing customer feedback to a small group of people.\n    \n*   **It aligns with our values.** We only earn revenue when the platform enables you to help customers.\n    \n\nA contact is someone who received a reply from your team or had their question resolved by the AI assistant. Multiple conversations with the same person count as one contact.\n\nHere are three different ways to help determine the unique contacts you serve each month:\n\n*   For a quick estimate, multiply your total monthly ticket/email count by 0.7. This ratio is based on data we\u2019ve collected from other Help Scout customers and will help you make an educated guess.\n    \n*   Import your data once you\u2019ve started a free trial. We recommend importing at least 90 days of activity to get a precise contact count. You won\u2019t be charged for any imported conversations.\n    \n*   Sign up for the Free plan. Once you start helping customers, you can monitor your contact count and upgrade if you need more than 50 per month.\n    \n\nHelp Scout offers a 30-day money-back guarantee in case you\u2019re surprised by a bill. However, after a few months of using the platform, your contact count will be clear and predictable.\n\nDiscover Help Scout\u2019s pricing plans for customer support software that\u2019s built for growing businesses at a fraction of the cost of competitive tools.",
