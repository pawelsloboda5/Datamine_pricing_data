Setup only takes a few minutes. Once your setup is complete, team members keep sending emails and scheduling meetings as usual \u2013 Salesflare will capture this activity and make it trackable for the whole team.\n\n### Can I purchase for one month?\n\nYes, you can. Licenses for Salesflare are either billed monthly or annually. Monthly pricing is slightly more expensive, so if you are committed to improve your sales productivity: go for the annual plan. There is always a free trial!\n\n### Do you charge for onboarding us?\n\nNo. Getting onboarded properly is key to your long term success with Salesflare and we are 100% here to help you with it, entirely free of charge. We're even happy to organize a one-on-one training session for your whole team. Just ask for it [on the chat](mailto:%20support@salesflare.com).\n\n### Are there any features we need to pay extra for?\n\nThe pricing plans are exactly as listed above. There will be no features we will suddenly charge you extra for that will not be listed on this page. We consider these kinds of business practices to be deeply disrespectful to you as a customer.\n\n### Are there any limits to the amount of contacts I can have?\n\nIn Salesflare, there are no hidden limits to the amount of contacts, users, email templates, tracked emails, sent emails, custom fields, workflows, dashboards, or even sales pipelines. We won't hit you with any unexpected financial surprises.\n\n### What happens at the end of my trial?\n\nWe\u2019ll notify you via email before your trial ends. If you become a paying customer, you don't need to make a new account. You can keep working with your account and all its data that you added during the trial period. Additionally, we\u2019ll help you and your team to get fully onboarded and up to speed... for free.\n\n### What is the cancellation policy?\n\nYou can cancel your ongoing plan whenever you want and you\u2019ll stop being charged immediately. There is no need to sign a multi-year contract, or to alert us months before the next renewal.\n\nAward-winning CRM software\n--------------------------\n\nSalesflare has received numerous awards for its ease of use, ease of setup, ease of administration, and quality of support.
