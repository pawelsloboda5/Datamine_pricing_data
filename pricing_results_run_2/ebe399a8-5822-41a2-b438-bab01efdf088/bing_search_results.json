Office managers and administrators are always counted as active.\n    \n    This is automatically calculated at the end of each billing period, which means there is no need to manually activate/deactivate staff members. Your costs will also be significantly lower during the slow months!\n    \n*   [What is your support like?](https://www.timetopet.com/pricing#)\n*   [Can I Switch Between Plans?](https://www.timetopet.com/pricing#)\n*   [Do I have to sign a contract?](https://www.timetopet.com/pricing#)\n\n**Trusted by over 4,000 of the World's Most Successful Pet Care Companies.**\n\n*   ![Image 25: hot diggity pet sitting logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-hotdiggity-h70.webp)\n*   ![Image 26: sitter 4 paws logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-sitter4paws2-h70.webp)\n*   ![Image 27: rock star dog walking and pet sitting logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-rockstar-h70.png)\n*   ![Image 28: sarahs pet care revolution logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-sarahs-pet-care-h70.webp)\n*   ![Image 29: the pet gal logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-petgal-h70.webp)\n\nIncluding these award winning companies\n\n![Image 30: Jill Next Door Pet Care logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-jill-nextdoor-h110.webp)\n\n**NAPPS 2025 Business of the Year**\n\n![Image 31: Fur Services Fur Pets logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-furservices.webp)\n\n**PSI's 2025 Pet Sitter of the Year**\n\n![Image 32: k9 kats pet sitting logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-k9-kats-h110.png)\n\n**NAPPS 2023 Business of the Year**\n\n![Image 33: bad to the bone pet care logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-bad-to-the-bone-h110.png)\n\n**PSI's 2023 Pet Sitter of the Year**\n\n![Image 34: fur services dog walking logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-furservices.webp)\n\n**NAPPS 2022 Business of the Year**\n\n![Image 35: lucky pup dog walking logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-luckypup-h110.png)\n\n**PSI's 2022 Pet Sitter of the Year**\n\n![Image 36: dans pet care logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-dans-petcare-h110.png)\n\n**PSI's 2021 Pet Sitter of the Year**\n\n![Image 37: crocketts care dog walking logo](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-crocketts-care-h110.png)\n\n**PSI's 2020 Pet Sitter of the Year**\n\n![Image 38: pet charmers pet care](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/company-logos/logo-pet-charmers-h110.png)\n\n**PSI's 2019 Pet Sitter of the Year**\n\n![Image 39](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/decor04.svg)\n\nExplore Features\n----------------\n\n*   [Client & Staff Mobile App](https://www.timetopet.com/mobile-apps)\n*   [Scheduling](https://www.timetopet.com/scheduling)\n*   [Billing & Invoicing](https://www.timetopet.com/invoicing)\n*   [Client Management](https://www.timetopet.com/client-management)\n*   [Staff Management](https://www.timetopet.com/staff-management)\n\n*   [Configuration](https://www.timetopet.com/configuration)\n*   [Client Conversations](https://www.timetopet.com/client-management/conversations)\n*   [Client Docs](https://www.timetopet.com/client-management/client-docs)\n*   [Recurring Appointments](https://www.timetopet.com/scheduling/templates)\n*   [Packages](https://www.timetopet.com/scheduling/packages)\n\n*   [Client Service Requests](https://www.timetopet.com/scheduling/client-service-requests)\n*   [Custom Fields](https://www.timetopet.com/configuration/custom-fields)\n*   [Happiness Surveys](https://www.timetopet.com/configuration/happiness-survey)\n*   [Quickbooks Integration](https://www.timetopet.com/invoicing/quickbooks-integration)\n*   [Security](https://www.timetopet.com/configuration/security)\n\n![Image 40](https://www.timetopet.com/marketing/images/decor10.svg) ![Image 41](https://www.timetopet.com/marketing/images/decor06.svg)\n\nWant to See More?\n-----------------\n\nWe can give you a full demo of Time To Pet, absolutely free.\n\n[Sign Up For A Demo](https://www.timetopet.com/demo)\n\n![Image 42](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/decor09.svg) ![Image 43](https://www.timetopet.com/dist/marketing/images/decor08.svg)\n\nFree 14 day trial.
