[Get in touch with us](https://www.discourse.org/contact).\n\nAre there educational or non-profit discounts?Yes! If you are legally recognized as an educational institution we offer an 85% discount. If you are legally recognized as a non-profit organization that is exempt from federal taxes, we offer a 50% discount. These discounts apply only to our Standard and Business plans, cannot be combined with other discounts, and must be paid through a debit/credit card monthly or annually. [Please contact us](https://www.discourse.org/contact) after starting your trial and we\u2019ll add the discount to your account.\n\nWhat if none of these plans fit my budget?Good news! Discourse is, and will always be, [100% free and open source](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) software. You may also want to self-host for reasons other than budget, including privacy or full control over the free software that you\u2019ve installed. [Here\u2019s how you can install it yourself](https://blog.discourse.org/2014/04/install-discourse-in-under-30-minutes/) on your own server.\n\nAlternatively, the community can install or host Discourse in the cloud for you. [Check out our list of trusted partners you can work with.](https://www.discourse.org/partners)\n\nCan I switch plans?Change plans any time for any reason. To upgrade instantly, visit your admin dashboard. To downgrade your plan, [please contact us](https://www.discourse.org/contact) and we\u2019ll make it happen.\n\nCan I transition from self-install to hosted, or vice-versa?Yes. Migrating from Discourse to Discourse using a backup is easy, and we\u2019ll take care of everything if you are moving to our hosting.\n\nWhat happens if I go over the plan limits?Your site will never stop working! If limits are exceeded for an extended period of time, we will get in touch with you to discuss flexible upgrade options.\n\nAnd, by the way, you can upgrade your plan at any time with a few clicks on your admin dashboard.\n\nCan I switch to a different host?Your data always belongs to you. Back up all your Discourse data right from your web browser, any time. Migrate to or from any cloud provider with ease.\n\nWho are your customers?We might be a little biased, but we think they\u2019re some of the finest companies and organizations in the world.
