Hubstaff offers a [free 14-day trial](https://hubstaff.com/signup).\n    \n*   Do I need to enter a credit card to start my free trial?\n    \n    No, we do not require a credit card to start a free trial.\n    \n*   What payment methods do you accept?\n    \n    Hubstaff accepts all major credit and debit cards. To manage your payment methods for your Hubstaff account, you can navigate to the billing section within your account settings.\n    \n*   Can I cancel at any time?\n    \n    Yes. There are two ways to cancel your Hubstaff subscription:\n    \n    1.  Contact [support@hubstaff.com](mailto:support@hubstaff.com) and request for your subscription to be canceled.\n        \n    2.  Archive the organization associated with your subscription. Doing so will automatically cancel your subscription.\n        \n    \n*   Can another entity redistribute Hubstaff?\n    \n    No. We do not allow the renting or redistribution of our products or services as stated in our [terms of service](https://hubstaff.com/terms):\n    \n    > **_\"You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublease the Service. These Terms will govern any upgrades provided by Hubstaff that replace and/or supplement the original Service. You agree to use your best efforts to protect the Service and upgrades from unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, publication, or alteration.\"_**\n    \n*   Do you offer a la carte pricing?\n    \n    Hubstaff offers affordable pricing plans for different team sizes and needs, plus annual payment options so you can get the most value out of our products. We also offer additional add-ons that you can add to our lower-tier plans (add-ons are automatically added to our higher-tier plans).\n    \n*   Do you offer a money-back guarantee?\n    \n    Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, excluding our 14-day free trial. When you cancel a plan, you can reach out to us at [support@hubstaff.com](mailto:support@hubstaff.com) and request a refund within 30 days of starting a paid plan.\n    \n    Please note that money-back guarantees **do not** apply to canceled users. For more details on altering the cost and number of users in your plan, check out our [refund policy](https://hubstaff.com/refund-policy).\n    \n*   What happens if I cancel my annual plan?\n    \n    Depending on the circumstances (e.g., if you haven\u2019t been using the app for months but forgot to cancel your subscription), you may be eligible for a limited refund. If you decide to cancel your annual plan, please contact our support team at [support@hubstaff.com](mailto:support@hubstaff.com).\n    \n*   What happens if I change the number of users on my annual plan?\n    \n    If you add seats in the middle of an annual plan, you will be charged the prorated fee per seat from the time you added them until the end of the current billing period. When you remove a user, the seat will be available to give to another team member at no additional charge. However, there are no prorated refunds or credits for removed users.\n    \n    As an example, let's say you're on Hubstaff's Team plan, which costs $10 per seat per month. If your billing period started in January and you added a new member in July, you would be charged a prorated amount of $60 for that seat (covering July through December).\n    \n*   What happens if I change the number of users on my monthly plan?\n    \n    If you add users to your monthly plan, they will be charged the full monthly rate for that billing cycle, with no proration. If you remove a user, their seat remains open for the rest of the billing cycle, allowing you to assign it to someone else. However, there are no prorated refunds or credits for removed users.\n    \n*   I don't track time. Do I need to pay for myself?\n    \n    Yes. Hubstaff charges per seat. This means that even if only two out of your three team members are using its tracking features, you will still have to pay for all three members.\n    \n    Users who don't want to track time and only want to view activity reports can be assigned the free Project Viewer role. For more information, please read our guide on\u00a0[Hubstaff roles and permissions](https://support.hubstaff.com/hubstaff-user-rolepermissions-guide/).\n    \n*   Does Hubstaff have a pro-ration policy?\n    \n    Yes, Hubstaff has a pro-ration policy on quarterly and annual plans, as it relates to adding seats.\n    \n    If you add seats during an annual plan, you\u2019ll be charged a prorated fee for each seat based on the time you added them and the remaining time on the plan.
