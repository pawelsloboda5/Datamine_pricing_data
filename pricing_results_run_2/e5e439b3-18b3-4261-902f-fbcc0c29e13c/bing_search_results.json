free plan require a credit card?\n\nNo, there is no credit card required for the free plan at sign up. You can send up to 6,000 emails per month (with a sending maximum of 200 emails per day). To access more features and increase sending volume you will be required to upgrade.\n\n### Do the featured prices include VAT?\n\nUnless otherwise mentioned, all the prices featured on our website do not include VAT and are subject to the French VAT. European companies can be exempt from it if they provide an intra-Community VAT number when they sign up.\n\n### Can I stop my subscription at anytime?\n\nYes, if you choose one of our monthly plans. They are without engagement, so you can switch to our free plan at any time.\n\n### What payment methods do you offer?\n\nIn addition to credit card payments, Mailjet also accepts wire transfers. You can subscribe to a prepaid account (the minimum deposit is $50USD). When your plan is renewed, the fee will be taken from your prepaid account. We do not accept cheques.\n\n### What if I go over my plan\u2019s limit?\n\nIf you run out of email credit, you can still send more emails, but these will be billed. See\u00a0[price](https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/8625025643803-Mailjet-Subscription-Management#h_01J91BJYJAS340NYFDA3Z8Z0HW)\u00a0per additional 1,000 emails beyond plan limit.\n\n### What happened to my unused email credits?\n\nEmail credits don\u2019t roll over from one month to another and unused emails expire at the end of each billing cycle. You can upgrade or downgrade at anytime, to adjust your plan according to your needs.\n\n*   deliv-team@mailjet.company\n*   outbound-sales@mailjet.company\n*   spamtrapmonitoring@mailjet.company\n*   pop@mailjet.top\n*   manu@mailjet.top\n*   tonyparker@mailjet.top\n\n[](https://www.mailjet.com/)\n\nSubscribe to the Mailjet Newsletter\n\nSend me the Mailjet newsletter.
