plans, designs and security\n\nCan I edit your templates?\n\nYes, you can! Add, delete, or change sections as you see fit. Make a mistake? Just import the template from the Marketplace again and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a template for my industry, what can I do?\n\nNot to worry - all of our templates can be quickly adapted to suit your needs. Many users also prefer to import their own templates, so whether you want something all your own or something fast & easy, there\u2019s a template for you.\n\nWill my clients see your logo?\n\nThat\u2019s up to you! Our Premium and Enterprise plans allow you to remove our branding and logo from your documents, giving a clean, white-label feel. Or, you can keep our logo and branding active and earn a commission when recipients sign up for Better Proposals.\n\nAre my documents secure?\n\nYes, absolutely. Better Proposals uses 256bit SSL security to protect your account.\n\nYour documents are always private, and every recipient is given their own unique encrypted link that can\u2019t be intercepted or accessed by anyone else.\n\nCan I change my plan after purchase?\n\nYes! Test out any of the plans above, and if it\u2019s not working, you can upgrade or downgrade whenever you want, as often as you want.\n\nI\u2019m not a designer. How do I make my document look presentable?\n\nBetter Proposals handles font spacing, colour schemes, and design details by default. We\u2019ll take care of the minor details so you can focus on landing the sale. Feeling stuck? Contact Support and we\u2019ll help you along.\n\nWhat about custom plans?\n\nEnterprise users can send unlimited documents and every plan allows you to add as many users as you need, so you have ultimate flexibility.\n\nCan you answer another question not listed here?\n\nYes! We can answer questions in as little as 2 minutes, and we do that 24 hours a day.\n\nStart a chat in the bottom right for a quick answer or [email us](mailto:support@betterproposals.io) and we\u2019ll get back to you shortly.\n\nGet Started Free with Better Proposals\n--------------------------------------\n\nStart sending beautifully designed, error-free documents that inspire immediate trust with your clients.
