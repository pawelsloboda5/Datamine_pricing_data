With so many features across all plans, figuring out if Pumble is for you can come down to simple answers.\n\n[##### Is Pumble really free?](javascript: void(0))\n\nYes! You can have an unlimited number of users and access your entire chat history. If you need more, you can upgrade to the PRO, BUSINESS, or ENTERPRISE plan.\n\n[##### Do you offer any discounts?](javascript: void(0))\n\nIf you pay annually, you get 2 months for free. Our FREE plan doesn't have any limitations and is perfectly suited for startups and non-profit organizations.\n\n[##### What types of payment are supported?](javascript: void(0))\n\nWe support payments by credit card for all plans. For larger purchases (e.g. annual multi-seat licenses), we also support wire transfers and purchase orders - in which case, it's best to contact us at [sales@pumble.com](mailto:sales@pumble.com).\n\n[##### What is a seat?](javascript: void(0))\n\nEach active and invited user on a paid plan requires a paid seat. If you deactivate some user, you free up their paid seat so you can invite a new user. If you buy another seat mid-cycle, you'll be charged a prorated price for that billing cycle.\n\n[##### What is a workspace?](javascript: void(0))\n\nWorkspace is your organization's place on Pumble where you can communicate and work with your team. Workspace is made up of channels, direct messages, team members and apps, making team collaboration much easier.\n\n[##### What type of user roles can you have in Pumble?](javascript: void(0))\n\nIn Pumble, you have three types of user roles: regular members, guests, and invited members. Regular members have full access to use the features in your Pumble workspace. Guests have limited access to certain channels inside Pumble, and their seats are priced. Invited members do not have a Pumble account, are not part of your workspace, and you do not have to pay for them. They only have access to the video conferencing calls to which they are invited.\n\n[##### How does guest access work?](javascript: void(0))\n\nYou can have single-channel and multi-channel guests. Multi-channel guests will be priced as regular users, while for every priced seat, five single-channel guests will be gratis.\n\n[##### What complementary services do I get as a qualified client?](javascript: void(0))\n\nAt CAKE.com, our clients\u2019 success is our success. That\u2019s why we offer concierge services to help you adopt our products smoothly. Qualified clients receive complementary services, including:\n\n*   Tailored implementation and onboarding plan together with tailored materials and resources (text/image/video)\n*   Additional consulting sessions, ongoing training, help with custom integrations, and more\n*   Product usage & optimization reviews\n*   Usage reports and best practice recommendations\n*   New feature releases (email)\n\n[##### Are there any additional taxes?](javascript: void(0))\n\nIt depends on your company's country of origin. All the prices are displayed without taxes, and if we are legally required to collect VAT from your country, then that tax will be added on top of the final price, which you will see at checkout before making a payment.\n\n[##### How does canceling work?](javascript: void(0))\n\nYou can cancel subscription at any time. Once you cancel, you can use the paid features until the end of you billing cycle, after which you'll be automatically downgraded to the FREE plan. We don't offer refunds.\n\n[##### How to get Pumble + Clockify + Plaky together?](javascript: void(0))\n\nYou can get all three CAKE.com tools upgraded for a special price and save 53% on paid subscriptions. To buy the CAKE.com Bundle (which includes ENTERPRISE version of Pumble, Clockify, and Plaky), go the [upgrade page](https://app.pumble.com/) and choose the CAKE.com Bundle plan.\n\nMore questions?
