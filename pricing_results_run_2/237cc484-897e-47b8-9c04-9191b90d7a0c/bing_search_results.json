The DNS look ups are fast and the management of allow/deny lists is pretty easy. Reporting is useful. There are some cool features for granular management at an individual machine level. The price is quite reasonable for what it does. It's pretty much set and forget.\n\nIt's raining malware but I won't reach for my Umbrella, but DNSFilter instead\n\n![Image 28: g2](https://www.dnsfilter.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Dnsfilter_March2023/images/632de69aaa6ae2783379b002_g2.png?width=111&height=116&name=632de69aaa6ae2783379b002_g2.png)\n\nThe ease of use and overall ability to block applications, limit search engines, block a number of threat types and add good sites to a whitelist or block a known bad site in a blacklist.

The interface is very user-friendly. If you have any issues, the customer support chat is handy. You get connected to an actual human, not just a chatbot.\n\nFast to deploy, protect an entire network in a minute\n\n![Image 33: Gartner peer Insights](https://www.dnsfilter.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Dnsfilter_March2023/images/62fd0314308e3b39ed19b191_gartner-peer.png?width=200&height=120&name=62fd0314308e3b39ed19b191_gartner-peer.png)\n\nGood web filtering for all our locations, we also deployed the roaming client to cover our users when they are outside the company network. It is also our first level of defense if there is a threat as the domain might be blocked before our EPP / EDR detect something.\n\nEasy-to-use DNS security solution\n\n![Image 34: G2_Logo_Red_RGB](https://www.dnsfilter.com/hubfs/G2_Logo_Red_RGB.svg)\n\nI love how DNSFilter is constantly being updated with new features and security updates. This gives me peace of mind knowing that my business is always protected from the latest online threats.\n\nFinally, a DNS filter that actually works!\n\n![Image 35: Gartner Peer Insights](https://www.dnsfilter.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Dnsfilter_March2023/images/62fd0314308e3b39ed19b191_gartner-peer.png?width=200&height=120&name=62fd0314308e3b39ed19b191_gartner-peer.png)\n\nDNSFilter has proven to be one of the easiest solutions to implement.
