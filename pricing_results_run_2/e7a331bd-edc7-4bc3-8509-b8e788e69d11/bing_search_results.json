It gives you exactly what you are looking for which was in my case to extract order data from pdf documents. Pros: Pricing model is great. You can use a full version for free as testing version as long as you only need a few test documents. Later on the more the usage grows the smaller the price gets per document.Many and also very easy ways to connect Docparser to our system environment.There is always a way to extract exactly the information that we need (sometimes a little complicated (see below) Cons: Some functions are only available in tables and others only in running text. From time to time I was searching for a function I needed, but could not find it. But in the end there was always a way to make it work.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Raja L. \n\n \n\n2023-05-06\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**Easy to use software and API which has enabled us to totally automate invoice capture**\nOverall: Very happy with our use of DocParser in our project Pros: Easy to integrate into our systems and can grow with our needs and scale up.

Our engineers took to it easily and we have implemented it for a number clients and it has proven to be equivalent to any enterprise capture tool in the market. Very happy. Highly recommended. Cons: Not local partner manager in Australia. Would be good to have a direct sales engagement. Having said that remote support is very responsive and easy to navigate.\n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n Karen F. \n\n \n\n2022-11-15\n\n \n\n \n\n Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Capterra. \n\n**Docparser was perfect for bulk batch data extraction!**\nOverall: I had a great experience using Docparser and will have no problem using them in the future.

Pros: Ease of use. Setup fast. No special training needed. Quinn from Docparser is always available to answer questions Cons: Its pricing.
