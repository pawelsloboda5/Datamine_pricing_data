Proposals look beautiful from the client's perspective, and they are more effective than any of the other solutions I've tried. I have been using it for a few years now and would not consider using anuything else. We can produce proposals that used to takes us 2 hours in about 15 minutes.

Chat with us below.\n\nCan I cancel my account?\n\nAbsolutely! You can cancel your account at any point during your billing cycle to prevent future renewals. Rest assured, you'll continue to enjoy access to all of Proposify's features until the end of your current subscription period. Please note that we do not offer refunds once the payment has been processed.\n\nHow do I get access to additional features and services?\n\nYou can upgrade your plan at any time to access additional features.\n\nIf you are interested in the premium features and services listed on our Business plan,\u00a0[please get in touch](https://www.proposify.com/demo), and we can set up the right plan for you.\n\nWhat is included in the free trial?\n\nOur free trial gives you access to all of the features on our\u00a0[Team plan](https://proposify.com/pricing)\u00a0for 14 days. We recommend taking things for a spin to see which ones work best for your team and process. You can create and send real proposals to real clients during your trial. Once your trial is over, your clients can still view and accept any proposals you sent to them during the trial period.\n\nWhat happens when I am at my send limit?\n\nSome of our plans limit how many documents you can send each month.\n\nOnce you are at your send limit you can send an additional document for a low one-time fee per send.\n\nThe amount of sends will roll over each month so they will accumulate if you don't use them.\n\nHow many contacts can I have?\n\nAll plans include unlimited contacts. You can import your contacts directly via one of our CRM integrations.\n\nWe need to get our documents set up quickly and need a fresh take on the design. Does Proposify offer support?\n\nWe certainly do! If you are looking to elevate your deal design and get a more customized look and feel, we are here to help. We have a team of talented and experienced designers in-house to support our customers and ensure they are set up for success. They know proposals and how to make your documents shine through design and work for your unique sales process. Check out our\u00a0[Professional Services](https://www.proposify.com/professional-services)\u00a0page for more information and let us transform your proposals so you can be ready to impress.\n\nYou don't have a template specific to my industry. Can I create one or can Proposify design one for me?\n\nAbsolutely! While we have an extensive\u00a0[proposal template](https://www.proposify.com/proposal-templates)\u00a0library for most projects and industries, all our templates are 100% customizable. This means you can create and update the content to match your brand and style guidelines. You can also paste text from other programs like Google Docs and Word for an easy transition.\n\nHowever, if you have a specific template you are currently using and don\u2019t have the time to get things set up, our team of in-house designers can help. Check out our\u00a0[Professional Services page](https://www.proposify.com/platform/professional-design-services) for more information.\n\nWhat are your support hours?\n\nOur team is here to provide their fabulous support Monday - Thursday 8 AM - 8 PM EST and on Fridays 8 AM - 4 PM EST.\n\nWill my proposal data be safe?\n\nKeeping your data safe is a priority. We are dedicated to doing this through continued compliance efforts, ongoing audits, and 24/7 system monitoring to ensure we meet and exceed industry standards. Proposals are sent using secure encrypted links and we never disclose your information to third parties. We partner with Amazon for cloud hosting and your data is protected by 256-bit SSL security. We are also GDPR and SOC2 compliant. Learn more on our\u00a0[Security](https://www.proposify.com/security)\u00a0page.\n\nWhat if my prospects don't speak English?\n\nYou can translate our interface into 15 languages to make it easier for your non-English speaking clients. However, we do not translate the content of your proposals or the emails sent through Proposify so you will need to make those adjustments.\n\n*   [Get started free](https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/click?encryptedPayload=AVxigLJZNl0ljGIeSFYUY6h8jpd7LcjHgg2xVdlPONNMBcw9%2F%2FqqJ2n8T6aqDL1znJPBm2Cj0z%2BmRoLs4sGnysWOZcW7KYnfTDULpdxGtQzyi6AjH0E5Jbu3yW2kLg1PO6Um%2BACZKo2XY7hZmvdxbf1dgdpY4%2FzT4qqC5Z0yqaA%2Bb%2FaDXv81GCg%3D&portalId=5261428&webInteractiveContentId=168406268179&webInteractiveId=332438022999&containerType=EMBEDDED&pageUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.proposify.com%2Fpricing&pageTitle=Proposify+Pricing&referrer=&userAgent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F135.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&hutk=d5a94e91bc9ac9ac1431372ee43c48d0&hssc=63846064.1.1744714187690&hstc=63846064.d5a94e91bc9ac9ac1431372ee43c48d0.1744714187690.1744714187690.1744714187690.1&pageId=167940529557&analyticsPageId=167940529557&hsfp=608284045&canonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.proposify.com%2Fpricing&contentType=standard-page)\n    \n*   [Book a demo](https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/click?encryptedPayload=AVxigLJtWedIeW99hCcZUUCBvperYV0hkIKXZup8kb%2BRXJ8bh4iyuEP4FOiJ0TSzr%2FLeeq4lZ8WQzuWMMwNKQdKPtj12ZrT1b3HTBfc7RTk0ttjDQ6FMN7KhvG1WQBX1APJD6A5rKhUqJ46E5WjhB9UgOirUvIvJZjEScQMaNyIzdGemow%3D%3D&portalId=5261428&webInteractiveContentId=168406268179&webInteractiveId=332438022999&containerType=EMBEDDED&pageUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.proposify.com%2Fpricing&pageTitle=Proposify+Pricing&referrer=&userAgent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F135.0.0.0+Safari%2F537.36&hutk=d5a94e91bc9ac9ac1431372ee43c48d0&hssc=63846064.1.1744714187690&hstc=63846064.d5a94e91bc9ac9ac1431372ee43c48d0.1744714187690.1744714187690.1744714187690.1&pageId=167940529557&analyticsPageId=167940529557&hsfp=608284045&canonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.proposify.com%2Fpricing&contentType=standard-page)\n    \n\nContact Sales\n-------------\n\nWe're happy to answer any questions you have and take you on a tour of the product.  \nFill out the form below and we'll be in touch!\n\nBusiness Email\\*\n\nBusiness Name\\*\n\nFirst name\\*\n\nLast name\\*\n\nPhone number\\*\n\nHow many people are on your Sales Team?\\*\n\nLead source\n\nLead Detail - Latest\n\nClearbit Form Status\n\nutm\\_campaign\n\nutm\\_content\n\nutm\\_medium\n\nutm\\_source\n\nutm\\_term\n\n![Image 25: Proposify logo](https://www.proposify.com/hubfs/assets/images/logos/logo-full-color.svg)\n\n*   [Platform](https://www.proposify.com/proposal-software)\n    *   [Proposal Automation](https://www.proposify.com/document-automation)\n    *   [Quoting](https://www.proposify.com/quoting-software)\n    *   [Contract Management](https://www.proposify.com/contract-management-software)\n    *   [E-Signatures & Forms](https://www.proposify.com/electronic-signature-software)\n    *   [Integrations](https://www.proposify.com/integrations)\n    *   [API](https://apidocs.proposify.com/)\n    *   [Security](https://www.proposify.com/platform/security)\n    *   [Our Professional Services](https://www.proposify.com/platform/professional-design-services)\n*   [Solutions](javascript:;)\n    *   [Sales](https://www.proposify.com/solutions/sales-leaders)\n    *   [Marketing](https://www.proposify.com/solutions/marketing)\n    *   [IT/Operations](https://www.proposify.com/solutions/operations)\n*   [Resources](https://www.proposify.com/resources)\n    *   [Blog](https://www.proposify.com/blog)\n    *   [Templates](https://www.proposify.com/proposal-templates)\n    *   [Webinars](https://www.proposify.com/resources/webinars)\n    *   [Books & Guides](https://www.proposify.com/resources/books-guides)\n    *   [Knowledge Base](https://support.proposify.com/)\n    *   [AI Proposal Generator](https://www.proposify.com/ai-proposal-generator)\n*   [Company](javascript:;)\n    *   [About](https://www.proposify.com/company/about)\n    *   [Diversity](https://www.proposify.com/company/diversity)\n    *   [Careers](https://www.proposify.com/company/careers)\n    *   [Customers](https://www.proposify.com/customers)\n\n\u00a92025 Proposify Inc.

We get to see how long they have viewed the quote, which page they are currently viewing, if they have clicked on any elements and also a nice E-mail alert when they first open the quote and if they have successfully accepted the quote. We have closed hundreds of sales outside of business hours because of the simplicity for the customer to edit their quote, accept it and then pay for it immediately.\n\n  ![Image 22:  Craig M.](https://www.proposify.com/hubfs/Testimonials/craig.webp)\n\nCraig M. Chief Operating Officer\n\nRidiculously Useful Proposal Builder\n\nIt's simple to create a new proposal from a template and customize it as necessary. Proposals look beautiful from the client's perspective, and they are more effective than any of the other solutions I've tried. I have been using it for a few years now and would not consider using anuything else. We can produce proposals that used to takes us 2 hours in about 15 minutes. And they close at a higher rate.\n\n  ![Image 23: Nate K](https://www.proposify.com/hubfs/Testimonials/Nate.jpeg)\n\nNate K.

Chat with us below.\n\nCan I cancel my account?\n\nAbsolutely! You can cancel your account at any point during your billing cycle to prevent future renewals. Rest assured, you'll continue to enjoy access to all of Proposify's features until the end of your current subscription period. Please note that we do not offer refunds once the payment has been processed.\n\nHow do I get access to additional features and services?\n\nYou can upgrade your plan at any time to access additional features.\n\nIf you are interested in the premium features and services listed on our Business plan,\u00a0[please get in touch](https://proposify.com/demo), and we can set up the right plan for you.\n\nWhat is included in the free trial?\n\nOur free trial gives you access to all of the features on our\u00a0[Team plan](https://proposify.com/pricing)\u00a0for 14 days. We recommend taking things for a spin to see which ones work best for your team and process. You can create and send real proposals to real clients during your trial. Once your trial is over, your clients can still view and accept any proposals you sent to them during the trial period.\n\nWhat happens when I am at my send limit?\n\nSome of our plans limit how many documents you can send each month.\n\nOnce you are at your send limit you can send an additional document for a low one-time fee per send.\n\nThe amount of sends will roll over each month so they will accumulate if you don't use them.\n\nHow many contacts can I have?\n\nAll plans include unlimited contacts. You can import your contacts directly via one of our CRM integrations.\n\nWe need to get our documents set up quickly and need a fresh take on the design. Does Proposify offer support?\n\nWe certainly do! If you are looking to elevate your deal design and get a more customized look and feel, we are here to help. We have a team of talented and experienced designers in-house to support our customers and ensure they are set up for success. They know proposals and how to make your documents shine through design and work for your unique sales process. Check out our\u00a0[Professional Services](https://www.proposify.com/professional-services)\u00a0page for more information and let us transform your proposals so you can be ready to impress.\n\nYou don't have a template specific to my industry. Can I create one or can Proposify design one for me?\n\nAbsolutely! While we have an extensive\u00a0[proposal template](https://www.proposify.com/proposal-templates)\u00a0library for most projects and industries, all our templates are 100% customizable. This means you can create and update the content to match your brand and style guidelines. You can also paste text from other programs like Google Docs and Word for an easy transition.\n\nHowever, if you have a specific template you are currently using and don\u2019t have the time to get things set up, our team of in-house designers can help. Check out our\u00a0[Professional Services page](https://proposify.com/platform/professional-design-services) for more information.\n\nWhat are your support hours?\n\nOur team is here to provide their fabulous support Monday - Thursday 8 AM - 8 PM EST and on Fridays 8 AM - 4 PM EST.\n\nWill my proposal data be safe?\n\nKeeping your data safe is a priority. We are dedicated to doing this through continued compliance efforts, ongoing audits, and 24/7 system monitoring to ensure we meet and exceed industry standards. Proposals are sent using secure encrypted links and we never disclose your information to third parties. We partner with Amazon for cloud hosting and your data is protected by 256-bit SSL security. We are also GDPR and SOC2 compliant.
