User data can ultimately lead to business insights that drive better decisions and save time, money, and resources.\n    \n*   ### What happens to my data if I exceed my plan\u2019s limits?\n    \n    When you reach a usage limit, the system will send you a notification email and warn you on your dashboard. You can upgrade your subscription to increase your limits or delete and purge your form submissions to free up space.\n    \n    Please note that if you exceed your total submission storage, the system will delete the oldest form response to make room for new submissions. To avoid losing data, you can download your old submissions and purge them. For detailed information, check out [this](https://www.jotform.com/help/408-understanding-your-account-usage-and-limits/) help guide.\n    \n*   ### What are the form usage metrics and limits that Jotform uses?\n    \n    **Form limit:** The form limit refers to the maximum number of forms that can be active on your plan.\n    \n    **Usage limit:** The usage limit is the maximum number of times you can use a feature. Only the API call limit resets daily.\n    \n    **Submission limit:** A form submission is the data collected when a user successfully completes a form. The submission limit refers to the total number of form responses from all forms that your account can support on a monthly basis.\n    \n    **Form view limit:** The form view limit refers to the total number of times your forms can be viewed account-wide on a monthly basis. For more information, see [Form View Limits](https://www.jotform.com/help/355-form-view-limits-what-is-it-all-about/).\n    \n    **Form field limit:** A form field is an element of a form, such as a text box, calculator, or signature field.

Users on other Jotform plans can remove this branding and replace it with their own.\n    \n*   ### Which payment methods does Jotform accept for its plans?\n    \n    Jotform accepts payments via credit/debit card or PayPal.\n    \n*   ### Which currencies does Jotform support?\n    \n    Jotform charges its users in U.S. dollars or euros, depending on where you are located.

Any additional features included with your new plan will be available as soon as you upgrade. When upgrading your subscription, the unused time on your previous plan will be applied to your new plan, and you will pay a prorated subscription rate.\n    \n    When you downgrade to a plan with lower limits, these will be effective immediately. The unused time on your plan will be added to your account as a balance and will be used for your next invoice.\n    \n    If you would like to cancel your subscription and move to the Starter (free) plan, follow [this guide](https://www.jotform.com/help/341-how-to-cancel-a-subscription-and-downgrade-back-to-free/).

Jotform uses Google Cloud and AWS for all our data center hosting needs and doesn\u2019t maintain any in-house servers. Also, Jotform complies with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Please visit the [Jotform security page](https://www.jotform.com/security/) to learn more about it.\n    \n*   ### What are the AI agents usage metrics and limits that Jotform has?\n    \n    Jotform\u2019s AI Agent usage metrics and limits include several key parameters. The AI Agent limit defines the maximum number of active AI Agents in your account. Monthly Conversations refer to the total AI Agent conversations allowed per month, including both chat and phone interactions. Monthly Sessions cover chatbot views, page refreshes, and phone call starts, even if no active user interaction occurs. Monthly Voice Calls represent the total minutes AI Agents can use for phone or web call interactions each month. Monthly SMS specifies the maximum number of user SMS messages sent to all AI Agents in your account per month. The Knowledge Base limit determines the total character count for knowledge resources across all AI Agents, including plain text, documents, Q&As, and URLs. Additionally, you can opt for a Dedicated Phone Number (Phone Number Add-On) for an extra fee to provide personalized services to your customers.\n    \n*   ### What is the difference between a Voice Call and a Phone Call?\n    \n    In terms of AI Agents, a phone call refers to calls made using a Dedicated Phone Number or a Regular Number with an extension number. These calls go through traditional telephony systems and require an actual phone number to connect.\n    \n    On the other hand, a voice call is a web-based call made through a platform without using a Dedicated Phone Number. It operates over the internet rather than through a traditional phone network.\n    \n    It\u2019s important to note that the Monthly Voice Call Limit is shared between both Voice Calls and Phone Calls, meaning usage of either type will count towards the same limit.\n    \n*   ### What is AI Agent\u2019s Phone Number Add-on and what are its features?\n    \n    \u200bThe Phone Number Add-on provides a dedicated phone number for your AI agent, enabling it to handle calls seamlessly. This feature ensures that your AI agent can interact with customers over voice, offering a more personalized experience. Calls made using this dedicated number count toward the shared Voice Call Limit.\n    \n*   ### What are the period options for the Phone Number Add-on?\n    \n    The Phone Number Add-on is available with two subscription period options: Monthly and Yearly. You can choose the plan that best fits your needs. However, please note that you can save up to 20 percent off if you choose the yearly subscription model.\n    \n*   ### Can I buy a Dedicated Phone Number Add-on on Jotform\u2019s Starter plan?\n    \n    Yes, you can purchase the Dedicated Phone Number Add-on on our Starter plan. The add-on is available as an additional feature regardless of your subscription plan.\n    \n*   ### How can I reactivate my previous Phone Number?\n    \n    Unfortunately, you can\u2019t reactivate a previous phone number. Once a phone number is deactivated or the subscription is canceled, it cannot be reclaimed. You will need to purchase a new Dedicated Phone Number Add-on if you need a new number, but it won\u2019t be the same as your previous one.\n    \n*   ### Can I use my AI agent with an Extension Number?\n    \n    Yes, you can use your AI agent with an Extension Number found on the Publish tab of your Agent. However, please note that it may be challenging since callers will need to manually enter the extension to reach your agent. This process can be time-consuming and may affect the user experience.\n    \n*   ### Which country phone number can I use with the Dedicated Phone Number?\n    \n    You can select a Dedicated Phone Number from the United States, United Kingdom, or Canada. These numbers can be purchased globally and are accessible to callers worldwide.\n    \n*   ### Can I choose a specific area code for my AI Agent\u2019s phone number?\n    \n    If you select the United States or Canada as the country when purchasing a dedicated phone number, you can also select an area code.\n    \n*   ### Are the Dedicated Phone Number Add-ons one-time purchases?\n    \n    No, Dedicated Phone Number Add-ons are recurring subscriptions unless canceled. They will renew automatically based on the selected monthly or yearly billing cycle.\n    \n*   ### How can I manage my phone number subscription?\n    \n    You can manage your phone number subscription by going to your Jotform account Settings and navigating to the Billing section. From there, you can update or cancel your subscription as needed.\n    \n*   ### How do AI Agents improve data accuracy?\n    \n    AI Agents improve data accuracy by validating inputs in real-time and formatting user responses according to the required structure of a form. This reduces manual errors and enhances data consistency.\n    \n*   ### How secure is the data handled by AI Agents?\n    \n    Jotform AI Agents adhere to industry-standard security protocols, ensuring that all data collected and processed is secure and encrypted.\n    \n*   ### What AI service does AI Agents use?\n    \n    Jotform AI Agents use OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, hosted in a secure cloud environment, to provide responses.\n    \n*   ### What are the security measures of the AI service?\n    \n    OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 is designed with enterprise-grade security, including encryption of data in transit and at rest and features supporting compliance with major regulations, like GDPR.\n    \n*   ### Are AI Agents compliant with GDPR/CCPA?\n    \n    Jotform AI Agent features support compliance with global data protection regulations, ensuring transparency and control over personal data.\n    \n*   ### Are AI Agents HIPAA-friendly?\n    \n    Yes, we utilize Google\u2019s Gemini Models via Vertex AI for our HIPAA-compliant accounts, as it provides a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations.\n    \n    [Learn more](https://www.jotform.com/help/500-how-to-enable-hipaa-compliance/) how Jotform enables HIPAA compliance.\n    \n*   ### Does Jotform use the data collected through AI Agents to improve its services?\n    \n    Jotform doesn\u2019t use the data collected through AI Agents to improve its services or for any other purposes, as stated in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.jotform.com/privacy/). Data collected from AI Agents is kept private, though we may share your data with AI providers such as OpenAI \u2014 but in any case it will be kept secure. Your form and form field content is used to train your personal AI Agents, but your name and other personal data won\u2019t be used for such purposes. Learn more about Jotform AI Agents\u2019s [security features](https://www.jotform.com/ai/agents/security/).\n    \n*   ### What are the main benefits of AI Agents?\n    \n    AI Agents offer many benefits that enhance user experience and operational efficiency. They are friendly, communicating with users in a polite, empathetic, approachable, and supportive manner to foster trust and create a positive interaction experience. With real-time support, AI Agents provide instant answers and guidance, improving user satisfaction. Their scalability allows them to handle large volumes of interactions across multiple channels without compromising quality. Through personalization, AI Agents adapt to user behavior and preferences to deliver tailored experiences. They also enhance automation by streamlining workflows and handling repetitive tasks like approvals and data entry. Lastly, AI Agents improve efficiency by saving time and reducing costs through intelligent automation, replacing manual processes with smarter solutions.\n    \n*   ### What are the main components of Jotform AI Agents?\n    \n    Jotform AI Agents consist of several complex and essential components that enhance their functionality. Functions define the core capabilities of AI Agents, enabling them to perform various tasks. Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows them to understand and respond to user queries effectively. The Knowledge Base stores important information that AI Agents use to provide accurate answers. A Decision-Making Engine helps process inputs and determine the best responses. Integrations enable seamless connections with other tools and platforms, while Customization Options allow users to tailor AI Agents to their specific needs. Avatars enhance user interaction by adding a visual identity. Multi-Channel Support ensures AI Agents can operate across different communication platforms. Data Security and Compliance protect user information and maintain privacy standards. A Personalization Engine adapts interactions based on user preferences, and a Training Module helps AI Agents continuously improve their performance.\n    \n\nView More\n\nJotform\n\n*
