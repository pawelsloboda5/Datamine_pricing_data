Active requests are ones that your clients can access and fill out.\n\nSay your limit was 50.\n\nYou could send 50 requests right away. If a week later you mark them as \"complete\" or \"archived\", you'd be able to send 50 more.\n\nOnce you mark a request as complete or archived, your client will no longer have access.\n\nA migration is when we convert one of your existing online forms or PDF forms into a Content Snare template.\n\nPlus Plan = 1 free migration  \nPro Plan = 2 free migrations\n\nOne free migration is limited to 40 questions. Beyond this, we will provide a quote. If your plan includes multiple free migrations, you can\u00a0 combine them into one larger template.\n\nOnce you have signed up for a plan, simply email us a copy of the form you want to re-create in Content Snare.\n\nCustom features and pricing\n\nCustom Solution\n\nLets us work with you to help you unleash the full potential of Content Snare without restrictions. Whether you need 200 requests or 10000, we can tailor a plan to you.\n\n[Talk to us ![Image 3](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)](https://contentsnare.com/contact/)\n\n![Image 4](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n### All Plans Include\n\n![Image 6](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Unlimited clients / recipients\n\nCreate as many clients or recipients as you need.\n\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Unlimited reminders\n\nSet up as many email reminders as you like for each request.\n\n![Image 8](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Unlimited questions & upload areas\n\nRequests can include any number of questions or file uploads.\n\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Unlimited templates\n\nSave requests or sections as templates to use again later.\n\n![Image 10](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Drag and drop request builder\n\nSet up as many email reminders as you like for each request.\n\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Simple client portal\n\nYour clients get a link where they can access their request at any time from any device.\n\n![Image 12](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Approval system\n\nApprove questions or send them back for changes if needed.\n\n![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Pre-made email templates\n\nGet started quickly without writing your own reminder emails.\n\n![Image 14](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Integrations\n\nUse Content Snare as part of a greater workflow.\n\n![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/3517ffedee28ca86a67a7a4df4ed0ef2)\n\n#### Effortlessly transition with our\n\nOnboarding Service\n------------------\n\n### Get the benefits of Content Snare, without the time investment\n\nSetting up new software and training your team can be a daunting task.

Team members can create and edit requests. The people you send requests to do not count towards your limit.\n\nWhat is a request?\n\nA request is like a form. It can have any number of questions or file uploads.\n\nYou send a request to a person, then Content Snare will periodically remind the person to fill it out.\n\nIf you send one to another person, that\u2019s 2 separate requests.\n\nOnce a request is completed by the person, it no longer counts towards your plan limit.\n\nWill my clients know how to use it?\n\nThe client interface can be used by just about anyone. We often hear from happy customers that they are surprised that even their most technologically-challenged clients can use it.\n\nHow secure is Content Snare?\n\nProtecting your data, as well as your clients\u2019 data is our first priority. Content Snare uses several best-practice safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your information. Those include encryption, network isolation, firewalls and authentication. We regularly backup your data. Learn more about our security [here](https://contentsnare.com/security/).\n\nCan I change plans?\n\nYou can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. If you have a month where you need high volume, you can switch up for a month and down again later. It only takes a minute.\n\nWe pro-rate any fees paid. This means that when you upgrade, you only pay the difference for the remainder of your current billing cycle. When you downgrade, your account will be credited for the difference in price. That credit will discount future bills until it runs out.\n\nWhat forms of payment do you accept?\n\nAll major credit cards. For Custom plans over $2000 per year we can issue invoices payable by bank transfer in USD or AUD.\n\nHow often does Content Snare contact my clients?\n\nThat's totally up to you. There is a default communication template that defines how frequently your clients are sent reminders, but you can create as many as you like.\n\nDo you offer discounts for nonprofits?\n\nYep. You can use the chat widget to enquire or simply\u00a0[contact us](https://contentsnare.com/contact/).\n\nWhat is your cancellation and refund policy?\n\nYou can cancel at any time inside the application from the settings panel. You will retain access to your data until the end of your subscription period.\n\nWe don\u2019t offer refunds except in rare circumstances. You can trial the product for free for 14 days with no credit card.\n\nWhat if I hit my usage limits?\n\nYou will see a message that your plan limits have been exceeded. Upgrading is as simple as clicking the new plan you want inside the app. Downgrading is just as simple. In both cases, you would receive a credit for the remaining subscription period for the old plan. That then gets used by the new plan.\n\nI\u2019m worried it will take some time to set up. Can you help?\n\nLike most changes to your company process, there will definitely be some time involved in setting up Content Snare. However with templates, you can often set it up once and reuse that work over and over.\n\nIf you have questionnaires or forms that you would like us to replicate in Content Snare,\u00a0[contact us](https://contentsnare.com/contact/)\u00a0for a quote.\n\nWill I be charged tax?\n\nAustralian customers are charged GST.\n\n![Image 16](https://contentsnare.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Content-Snare-Content-Collection-Handbook-cover.jpg)\n\nInstead, grab our:\n\n1\\. **Content Collection Handbook** -\u00a0Our best advice on how to get what you need from clients on time, no matter what tools you use.\n\n2\\. **Success Blueprint** -\u00a0Everything you need to know about how to get the best results with Content Snare.\n\n3\\. **Boss Pitch Deck** -\u00a0This will help you convince your boss & team why you need Content Snare.\n\nAll free.
