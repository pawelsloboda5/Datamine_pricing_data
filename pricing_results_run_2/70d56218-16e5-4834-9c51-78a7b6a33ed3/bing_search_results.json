questionnaire and an expert will be happy to assist you!\n\n* * *\n\nQuestions?  \nWe're here to help.\n--------------------------------\n\nHow does pricing work?\n----------------------\n\nThe price of our plans is based on the number of contacts in your account. You can send unlimited emails to your contacts. For example, if you have 227 contacts, the Basic plan will cost $22.04 per month, the Plus plan will be $38.59 per month and the Pro plan, $49.61 per month. [Learn more](https://faq.cyberimpact.com/articles/178/our-plans?l=en_ca)\n\nHow often will I be billed?\n---------------------------\n\nYour credit card will be billed automatically every month on the anniversary date of your first invoice.\n\nCan I modify my plan?\n---------------------\n\nYou can change your plan any time. The monthly price will automatically adjust when the number of contacts in your mailing list changes.\n\nDo you have email lists available?\n----------------------------------\n\nNo. Our clients import and manage their own lists. We never sell email lists. That is specified in our [anti-spam policy](https://app.cyberimpact.com/anti-spam-policy?l=en_ca).\n\nHow can I stop my subscription?\n-------------------------------\n\nYou can stop your subscription at any moment by contacting our customer service department. It is also possible to go back to the free plan by changing your plan and reducing to 250 or less the number of your contacts.\n\nCyberimpact pricing : email marketing and newsletter.
