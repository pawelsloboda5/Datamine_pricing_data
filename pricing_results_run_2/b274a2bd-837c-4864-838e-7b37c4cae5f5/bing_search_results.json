While Skipio covers a portion of these fees, below you will find a breakdown of the costs you are responsible for.\n\n### Campaign carrier fee for general accounts\n\n$15/month flat fee\\*\n\nA \u201ccampaign\u201d is essentially a use case. It\u2019s the reason you\u2019re sending text messages. Common use cases include:\n\n*   marketing and promotional\n*   two-factor authentication\n*   account notifications\n*   customer care\n*   fraud alert\n*   transactional, related to sales and collections\n\nCurrently have or plan to have multiple Skipio numbers?\u00a0Multiple numbers from the same business can be associated with a single use case as long as your business is\u00a0not\u00a0a sole proprietorship.\n\n\\*Accounts created by signing up at mk.skipio.com through our Mary Kay portal are subject to a $5/month campaign carrier fee.\n\n### Vetting fee (optional)\n\n$40, a one-time fee\n\nAll standard businesses (any business that is\u00a0not a sole proprietorship) has the option to go through an additional vetting process from the carriers. Through vetting, your business becomes eligible for higher daily sending rates and faster sending speeds.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### What is 10DLC?\n\n10DLC is the new industry standard that US mobile carriers have created to help businesses safely and effectively communicate with customers through text messaging.\n\nCarriers want to help businesses send legitimate messages and prevent spam communication. Business text messaging has gone through major modifications just over the past few years as a result.\n\nThe introduction of 10DLC represents the latest effort to improve business communication and protect consumers because businesses must be verified with the carriers.\n\n### What is The Campaign Registry?\n\nThe Campaign Registry is the group formed by the mobile network carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) to track and monitor the businesses using those networks and what they\u2019re using them for.\n\n### Do I have to register my business?\n\nIn short, yes. Any business that wishes to send text messages to customers using Skipio must register.\n\nRegistering legitimizes your business with the carriers and allows you to send messages faster and at a higher volume. It\u2019s a more secure way of messaging people because your number has been verified by the carriers.\n\n### How does brand registration work?\n\nAfter\u00a0[choosing a Skipio plan](https://skipio.com/pricing), the brand registration and campaign registration forms appear.\n\n1\\. Carefully fill out your company\u2019s information\n\nDoing so incorrectly will affect your sending speed, delivery rates, and message volume. Providing falsified or inaccurate business information may result in fines/fees from the mobile carriers.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to provide business information like the following:\n\n*   Company name as it appears on tax returns\n*   Country of registration\n*   Company EIN\n*   Full business address\n*   Text-enabled mobile number\n*   Website\n*   Stock symbol (for publicly-traded companies)\n\nNot all of this information is required of every business type. If you are a sole proprietor, you won\u2019t have a company EIN, so make sure you select the Sole Proprietor option when registering your brand.\n\n2\\. Complete mobile verification\n\nThe phone number you provide when signing up for Skipio and completing the brand registration\u00a0must\u00a0be a text-enabled mobile number.\n\nYou will receive a text message that you must reply \u201cYES\u201d to in order to complete verification. Failure to complete registration means you won\u2019t be able to send text messages using Skipio.\n\n3\\. Complete the use case registration\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked to provide examples of the types of text messages you plan to send for business purposes.\n\nAll brand and use case information is then submitted to the mobile carriers.\u00a0As set by the mobile carriers, verification may take 5-10 business days.\u00a0During this time, the mobile carriers do not allow you to send text messages.\n\n4\\. Set up your Skipio account and build automations\n\nWhile the mobile carriers prevent you from sending text messages immediately, you gain access to Skipio and can still do things like:\n\n*   Customize your account settings\n*   Upload and sort contacts\n*   Install integrations\n*   Build drip messaging sequences\n\nWe will provide updates on the progress of your verification status and notify you when the mobile carriers approve your chosen Skipio phone number for sending text messages.\n\n### What are the campaign types?\n\nThe 10DLC messaging use cases are referred to as \u201ccampaigns.\u201d It\u2019s the reason you\u2019re sending text messages.\n\nCommon use cases include but are not limited to:\n\n*   marketing and promotional\n*   two-factor authentication\n*   account notifications\n*   customer care\n*   fraud alert\n*   transactional, related to sales and collections\n\nRegister your number with only the use case(s) applicable to your business and nothing extra to minimize fees.\n\nCompare Skipio Plans Side-by-Side\n---------------------------------\n\n###### Plans\n\nContacts\n\nOutbound messages\n\nUnlimited inbound messages\n\nMMS\n\nSMS/MMS

send texts right away?](https://skipio.com/pricing/#accordion-item-can-i-send-texts-right-away?)\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to send messages until your business is vetted by a Skipio team member.
