Method](https://signup.method.me/methodcrm)\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\nWhich features can I use during my free trial?\n\nAll of them! When you start your free trial, your account will automatically include all of the features in our CRM Pro plan. If you want the CRM Enterprise features, you can also add them for free during your trial.\n\nCan each member of my team be on a different plan?\n\nYes, absolutely. You can mix and match plans so you only pay for the features each user needs.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between monthly and annual billing?\n\nWith monthly billing, you pay for your account one month at a time. With our annual prepay plan, you get a 10% discount on your account by paying for 12 months upfront.\n\nWhat currency will I be billed in?\n\nWe bill in USD for all our customers except those from Canada. Canadian customers are billed in CAD.\n\nWhat is your cancellation policy?\n\nIf you are paying month-to-month, you can cancel your account anytime.\n\nIf you sign up for an annual prepay plan, there is a 30-day grace period during which you may switch to a monthly plan without penalty. After 30 days, if you wish to cancel your account before the end of your prepay period, you will not be eligible for a refund.\n\nDo you have specific plans for the field service industry?\n\nYes! Method:Field Services is designed specifically for service businesses. Pricing for this solution starts at $15 per month for field crew technicians and $45 per month for dispatcher licenses.

We have a CRM called Method:Donor that is designed and priced specifically for nonprofits.\u00a0[Click here to learn more](https://www.method.me/nonprofit-crm/).\n\nCan I change my plan?\n\nYou can upgrade your plan per user at any time. You can downgrade your plan per user at the end of your current billing cycle.\n\nCan I talk to a real person about my options?\n\nOf course \u2014 [chat with us!](https://www.method.me/pricing/#/) Our team is happy to help you figure out which plan is right for you.\n\nHow much does a CRM cost?\n\nWhen it comes to CRM software, there is no single answer to the question of cost. CRMs almost always employ a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS) model.\n\nThis means that as long as your business\u00a0 uses the software, you pay a regular subscription fee.\n\nThe actual cost of a CRM subscription varies widely. It is calculated based on the number of users you want to add, but it depends on the company you choose and your business\u2019 specific needs as well.\n\nGenerally, the smaller your business, the smaller your subscription fees will be. There are also free options out there, but very rarely will you find them worth your time.\n\nTypically, paid CRM software costs anywhere from $12 per user, per month, all the way to $300 per user, per month.\n\nThe most affordable options are best suited for smaller businesses, while the more expensive ones work well for large enterprises. For most businesses, though, the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. And that\u2019s exactly where Method CRM lands.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best CRM for small business?\n\nMethod CRM is the best CRM for small businesses. Outshining the competition in its capacity for both customization and automation, Method CRM works best for small-to-medium sized businesses. Here\u2019s why.\n\nAs your business grows, it requires more and more coordination. Method CRM knows this, and does everything in its power to strengthen your business\u2019 coordination in a way that\u2019s tailored to your specific needs. Method CRM automates your regular work processes to make life easier for everyone that works at your business, especially you.\n\nHow much does QuickBooks cost?\n\nThere are several packages that Intuit offers for prospective [QuickBooks](https://www.method.me/quickbooks-crm/) users. Before deciding which one\u2019s right for you, the first step is to decide between QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided which base QuickBooks software is best for your business, you can consider their packages at each price point.\n\n### For Desktop:\n\nQuickBooks Desktop has two price packages, and charges on a yearly cycle. The basic package, QuickBooks Desktop Premier Plus, starts at $799 a year.\n\nThe more advanced package, QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise, starts at $1,340 a year. However, prices can vary depending on how many users will be on your account.\n\n### For Online:\n\nQuickBooks Online has four price packages. It also frequently offers 50% off the first three months for each package, provided you skip the trial and buy immediately. Without discount, the price points are as follows.\n\nThe cheapest option, called Simple Start, is $30 per month. Then, there\u2019s the Essentials package, at $55 a month.\n\nNext, is QuickBooks Online\u2019s most popular package, Plus, at $85 per month.
