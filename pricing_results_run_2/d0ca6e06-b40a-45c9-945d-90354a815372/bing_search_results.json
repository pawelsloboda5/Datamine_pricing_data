It allows participants in my speaking events to give me direct feedback and it identifies among those people who is interested in booking or referring me for other speaking events. The reinforcing loop of opportunity generation is outstanding\n\nIf you do paid or unpaid presentations and want to do more, Talkadot is a great tool. You also get immediate feedback from audience members which is super-useful, and you get a link to share audience comments with whoever hired you to speak, which is a great sales tool for re-engagements.\n\n![Image 1](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/677df3bfb065267dc9d9863b/67b5a59ca560885e009d0d3e_Minda-Zetlin-Talkadot.webp)\n\nTalkadot has totally helped me build an email list where I've never been able to build one before. It has also helped me get fantastic data about my keynotes as well as immediate testimonials, booking leads as well as referrals. It has literally changed my speaking business.\n\n![Image 2](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/677df3bfb065267dc9d9863b/67b5a56e8e816411fa755d59_Kymberli-Speight-Talkadot.webp)\n\nAs a professional speaker, I appreciate the real-time feedback I'm able to garner from audience members via Talkadot because it helps me know how and what aspects of my message are and are not resonating with audiences.\n\n![Image 3](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/677df3bfb065267dc9d9863b/677df517a3eb025e64260cc0_Jasmine-Brett-Stringer_2.webp)\n\nTalkadot is the tool that SMART speakers use. Listen, you can go old school and TRY to collect feedback forms from your attendees. If you've ever done this, you know you never get enough of them completed. Or you can use Talkadot which totally streamlines the process AND continues to upgrade and uplevel the internal services that they offer for speakers. Love them and can't talk highly enough about the platform.\n\n![Image 4](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/677df3bfb065267dc9d9863b/67b5a5525d16d90e1da690e9_Malla-Haridat-Talkadot.webp)\n\nI just used it to counteract the lone voice who did not find my speech actionable. I shared with the meeting professional, well that individual was probably part of the 4% who did not and not the 96% who did. It was not a slam, I just had data.\n\n![Image 5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/677df3bfb065267dc9d9863b/67b5a53d8e816411fa753144_John-Register-Talkadot.webp)\n\nWhat is Talkadot?\n\nTalkadot helps speakers turn audience feedback into leads, testimonials, and rebookings\u2014effortlessly.\n\nDoes my audience need to download an app or anything?\n\nNo, they just scan a QR code or click a link\u2014no apps or downloads required.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat\u2019s included in the free version?\n\nYou get one feedback link, real-time analytics, and essential tools to start collecting leads and testimonials. No credit card required.\n\nHow does Talkadot help me grow?\n\nTalkadot turns audience feedback into data that proves your value\u2014helping event planners see why you\u2019re their best choice.\n\nIsn\u2019t this an invasion of privacy or a bother for my audience?\n\nNo. Your audience chooses what to share, and they can stay anonymous if they prefer. When people know their feedback is valued, they\u2019re more likely to engage\u2014making it a win-win for both you and your audience.\n\nWhat happens if I get negative feedback?\n\nNegative feedback is private to you, but testimonials work like third-party reviews\u2014honest, real, and credible. A few critical comments actually make your praise more trustworthy.\n\n\u200d\n\nI just want leads, not feedback. Is Talkadot for me?\n\nYes! Talkadot is built for effortless lead capture\u2014no forced surveys, no unnecessary friction. If you're focused purely on getting more bookings, Talkadot ensures that interested audience members can easily express interest in hiring you without extra steps. Unlike generic survey tools, it lets your audience engage on their terms while AI-powered insights highlight your most engaged leads so you can prioritize follow-ups. While many speakers use Talkadot for feedback, it\u2019s just as powerful as a straightforward lead-generation tool to help you turn every talk into your next gig.\n\n\u200d\n\nIsn\u2019t Talkadot too basic for seasoned speakers?\n\nThe best speakers know what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. Our tools go beyond feedback\u2014they help you optimize, book more speaking engagements, and raise your rates.\n\nWon\u2019t using Talkadot disrupt my speaking flow, especially if I like to end on a high note?\n\nTop speakers use Talkadot without disrupting their flow. A simple slide at the end keeps the energy up and engagement high. You control when and how you introduce it\u2014so it fits seamlessly into your style.\n\nMy event host already collects feedback. Why use Talkadot\n\nHosts collect event-wide feedback. Talkadot gives you speaker-specific insights to grow your business.\n\n\u200d\n\nI already have a system that\u2019s working. Why should I use this?\n\nThat\u2019s great! If your system is working, Talkadot isn\u2019t here to replace it\u2014it\u2019s here to enhance it. Many speakers already have a process for collecting feedback or tracking leads, but Talkadot makes it faster, more automated, and more effective.\n\nUnlike generic survey tools or manual tracking, Talkadot:\n\n*   Captures hot and warm leads in real time so you don\u2019t lose potential bookings.\n*   Automatically organizes audience feedback into an easy-to-use system.\n*   Surfaces engagement insights that help you refine your talk and increase referrals.\n\nIf your current system is manual, fragmented, or requires follow-ups that often slip through the cracks, Talkadot helps you make the most of every speaking opportunity without adding extra work.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing novel about this. It\u2019s just a survey tool\n\nTalkadot goes beyond surveys. We identify your hottest leads, turn audience engagement into rebookings, and generate testimonials\u2014all automatically. Typeform and SurveyMonkey can\u2019t do that.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you offer a monthly plan?\n\nAnnual plans give speakers the best results. We\u2019ve found that consistent use leads to more bookings\u2014so we price to support long-term success.\n\nHow do I know who\u2019s interested in booking me?\n\nTalkadot highlights your most engaged audience members so you know exactly who to follow up with for bookings.\n\nThis seems like a lot of work\n\nIt\u2019s not! Setup takes minutes, and once your slide is ready, you can reuse it forever\u2014or update your bonus anytime.\n\nCan\u2019t I just make my own QR code?\n\nA QR code just sends people to a link\u2014Talkadot does way more. We capture leads, identify who\u2019s most interested in booking you, generate testimonials, and automate follow-ups. No QR generator can do that.\n\n\u200d\n\nWill using Talkadot conflict with my speaker bureau or manager?\n\nNot at all. Talkadot doesn\u2019t replace bureaus. Talkadot helps speakers manage and close more opportunities. If you\u2019re represented, you can direct leads to your bureau while benefiting from the audience insights and engagement tools Talkadot provides. If you book independently or work with a manager, Talkadot simply helps you close more of the leads you're already getting.\n\n\u200d\n\nHave more questions? \u00a0Join us on one of our FREE live demos!\n\n[Apr 15, Tuesday @ 04:00 PM-05:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/3dG0KsJvT16ytH5sC792rg)[Apr 16, Wednesday @ 04:00 PM-05:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/8XvFkWRTTyyxl8dSaNgMbw)[Apr 21, Monday @ 06:00 PM-07:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/gsdJ3IWNS1qssXfjvtVbCA)[Apr 22, Tuesday @ 08:00 PM-09:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/PB7Kf_9BTUGQtGzs3F6gjQ)[Apr 28, Monday @ 06:00 PM-07:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/TIA3HO2lThK8pPzSQFnoUQ)[Apr 29, Tuesday @ 04:00 PM-05:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/OGydsVsUQLSlJ75FruVtTQ)[Apr 30, Wednesday @ 04:00 PM-05:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/ZsDaUUDuQ5Ssh0ADxlYTaw)[May 5, Monday @ 06:00 PM-07:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/FH4p45ZHTRiLf0WF-oFaKg)[May 6, Tuesday @ 04:00 PM-05:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/sgJch8fqTAWBK3A2b8Lc8w)[May 7, Wednesday @ 04:00 PM-05:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/qfccahXMRSmuA3pTitnXaQ)[May 12, Monday @ 06:00 PM-07:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/hY5TV2bvRImXg-XPe2UuJg)[May 13, Tuesday @ 04:00 PM-05:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/jEKqVoa3T7GJAzVNelNv1Q)[May 14, Wednesday @ 04:00 PM-05:00 PM (Africa/Abidjan) Talkadot Demo - Marisa Hosted Signup!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/ZcTd3WBsTxOikodgPlBw0Q)\n\nWant more booking leads and smarter insights from your audience?
