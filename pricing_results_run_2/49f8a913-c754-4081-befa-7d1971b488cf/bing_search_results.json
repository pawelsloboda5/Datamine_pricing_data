With a Premium plan you can connect your own domain, remove Wix branding from your site, and more. Most Premium plans include a 1 year free domain voucher, which is only valid with a purchase of a new domain from Wix and cannot be used to renew or extend a domain you already own. For best value, we recommend our yearly or multi-year plans.\n\n### Can I try a Wix Premium plan for free?\n\nYes. Try any Wix Premium plan and if you decide it's not for you, you can cancel within 14 days and receive a full refund\u2014no questions asked. This applies to the initial upgrade to a Premium plan.\n\n### How do I get my free domain?\n\nMost yearly or multi-year Premium plans come with a 1 year free domain voucher. You can choose your own domain name with suffixes such as .com, .net, .org and more. Once you find the perfect domain for your site, your voucher will be waiting for you at checkout. This voucher is only included with the first time purchase of a Premium plan. It is not included when renewing a plan or upgrading an existing plan. The voucher is redeemable within 60 days following your purchase, and is only valid towards the purchase of a new domain from Wix. The free domain voucher cannot be used to renew an existing domain.\n\n### Why do I need a custom domain?\n\nA custom domain, like mystunningwebsite.com, is a great way to get found online and promote your brand. Replace your free Wix URL (username.wixsite.com/sitename) with a custom domain you purchased from Wix, or one you already own.\n\n### How can I get my own personalized email address?\n\nOnce you have your own domain, you can purchase a Google Workspace plan and get a custom email address using your domain, like [info@mystunningwebsite.com](mailto:info@mystunningwebsite.com). We've partnered with Google to give you 30GB of Drive storage, as well as Google Calendar, Docs, Sheets and Slides.\n\n### Where can I find my billing information?\n\nSign into your Wix account and choose Billing & Payments from the main menu at the top-right of the page. You'll see all your subscriptions and billing history right there.\n\n### What online payments are accepted?\n\nWix accepts all major credit cards and debit cards, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB and Diners. Additional payment options may be available in your specific location.\n\n### How do I know if the Enterprise plan is right for my business?\n\nWix Enterprise gives leading businesses the power to create, launch and manage fully-customized sites and webpages at scale.
