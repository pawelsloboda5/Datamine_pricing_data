Typeform for Growth plans include all features on the Core plans.\n\n### How do I sign up?\n\nPick a plan above to get started. We\u2019ll ask you for a few basic details. Then you\u2019re in.\n\n### What features can I use for free?\n\nYou get these features on our free plan:\n\n\u200d\n\n*   Unlimited typeforms\n*   10 questions per typeform\n*   10 responses per month\n*   Logic jumps\n*   Multiple ending screens\n*   Hidden fields\n*   Calculator\n*   Templates\n*   Embed your typeform in a web page\n*   Download your data\n*   Zapier, Automate.io, Slack, Mailchimp, HubSpot, and other integrations\n\n\u200d\n\nYou can also try features from our paid plans. In that case, your typeform will go into trial mode. You won\u2019t be able to share it and collect responses unless you upgrade to a paid plan (or remove the trial features).\n\n### Do I need to know how to code?\n\n_true == false_\n\n\u200d\n\nJoke for the coders there. The answer is no.\n\n\u200d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to make a typeform. Pick a question type, write your question, then add images, design themes, fonts, backgrounds, and more.\n\n\u200d\n\nYou can even start with one of our [templates](https://www.typeform.com/templates) and just edit the text.\n\n### Do typeforms work on all devices?\n\nTypeforms look and feel great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.\n\n### Do I get a discount if I pay yearly instead of monthly?\n\nYou do, indeed. **16%** to be precise.\n\n### Is there a limit to the number of responses I can collect?\n\nEach plan comes with a number of responses/month included, and has its own maximum monthly response limit. Up to this limit, you can upgrade your responses/month as much as you want.\n\n\u200d\n\nIf you need more than 50,000 responses/month, [contact our sales team](https://tfsales.typeform.com/to/lhcebvr6?source=website&source2=public%20pricing%20page) to create a custom plan tailored to your business.\n\n### How is my data safe?\n\nThe security and integrity of your data are critically important for us, and we\u2019ve built our services around this idea. Once your information enters Typeform\u2019s systems (located in AWS), it\u2019s secured with multiple levels of encryption and access controls, for example:\n\n\u200d\n\n*   Your data in-transit is encrypted using secure TLS cryptographic protocols (TLS 1.2).\n*   Your data at rest is encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key.\n*   Redundant backups of critical data are also in place to ensure business continuity in case of disaster.\n\n\u200d\n\nFor more detail on the security measures, please visit [Security at Typeform](https://help.typeform.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029259552-Security-at-Typeform).\n\n### What can I do with my data once it's collected?\n\nYou can see all your responses in our Results area and create reports to share with your team, Twitter (X) follower, or local bus driver.\n\n\u200d\n\nTypeform [connects with hundreds of apps](https://www.typeform.com/connect) so you can go on and do much more with your data.\n\n\u200d\n\nAnd for the technically gifted, you can set up webhooks and use our APIs to create solutions that adapt to your business.

Typeform for Growth plans include all features on the Core plans.\n\n### How do I sign up?\n\nPick a plan above to get started. We\u2019ll ask you for a few basic details. Then you\u2019re in.\n\n### What features can I use for free?\n\nYou get these features on our free plan:\n\n\u200d\n\n*   Unlimited typeforms\n*   10 questions per typeform\n*   10 responses per month\n*   Logic jumps\n*   Multiple ending screens\n*   Hidden fields\n*   Calculator\n*   Templates\n*   Embed your typeform in a web page\n*   Download your data\n*   Zapier, Automate.io, Slack, Mailchimp, HubSpot, and other integrations\n\n\u200d\n\nYou can also try features from our paid plans. In that case, your typeform will go into trial mode. You won\u2019t be able to share it and collect responses unless you upgrade to a paid plan (or remove the trial features).\n\n### Do I need to know how to code?\n\n_true == false_\n\n\u200d\n\nJoke for the coders there. The answer is no.\n\n\u200d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to make a typeform. Pick a question type, write your question, then add images, design themes, fonts, backgrounds, and more.\n\n\u200d\n\nYou can even start with one of our [templates](https://www.typeform.com/templates) and just edit the text.\n\n### Do typeforms work on all devices?\n\nTypeforms look and feel great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.\n\n### Do I get a discount if I pay yearly instead of monthly?\n\nYou do, indeed. **16%** to be precise.\n\n### Is there a limit to the number of responses I can collect?\n\nEach plan comes with a number of responses/month included, and has its own maximum monthly response limit. Up to this limit, you can upgrade your responses/month as much as you want.\n\n\u200d\n\nIf you need more than 50,000 responses/month, [contact our sales team](https://tfsales.typeform.com/to/lhcebvr6?source=website&source2=public%20pricing%20page) to create a custom plan tailored to your business.\n\n### How is my data safe?\n\nThe security and integrity of your data are critically important for us, and we\u2019ve built our services around this idea. Once your information enters Typeform\u2019s systems (located in AWS), it\u2019s secured with multiple levels of encryption and access controls, for example:\n\n\u200d\n\n*   Your data in-transit is encrypted using secure TLS cryptographic protocols (TLS 1.2).\n*   Your data at rest is encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key.\n*   Redundant backups of critical data are also in place to ensure business continuity in case of disaster.\n\n\u200d\n\nFor more detail on the security measures, please visit [Security at Typeform](https://help.typeform.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029259552-Security-at-Typeform).\n\n### What can I do with my data once it's collected?\n\nYou can see all your responses in our Results area and create reports to share with your team, Twitter (X) follower, or local bus driver.\n\n\u200d\n\nTypeform [connects with hundreds of apps](https://www.typeform.com/connect) so you can go on and do much more with your data.\n\n\u200d\n\nAnd for the technically gifted, you can set up webhooks and use our APIs to create solutions that adapt to your business.
