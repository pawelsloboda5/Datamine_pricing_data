Actual pricing may vary depending on the type of agreement entered with Microsoft, date of purchase, and the currency exchange rate. Prices are calculated based on US dollars and converted using London closing spot rates that are captured in the two business days prior to the last business day of the previous month end. If the two business days prior to the end of the month fall on a bank holiday in major markets, the rate setting day is generally the day immediately preceding the two business days. This rate applies to all transactions during the upcoming month.

questions\n\n*   Each Azure DevOps organization gets one parallel job with 1,800 minutes (30 hours) of build time every month using Microsoft-hosted agents. If you need more time or would like to run more than one job at a time, simply buy the number of pipelines you need. When you buy your first Microsoft-hosted pipeline, the number of parallel jobs in the organization remains at one; this purchase removes only the time limit on the free pipeline. To run two jobs concurrently, buy two Microsoft-hosted pipelines.\n    \n    Additionally, each Azure DevOps organization gets one free self-hosted agent that can be used to run one parallel job with unlimited minutes. If you need to run more parallel jobs, simply buy more self-hosted pipelines.\n\nExplore the different Azure DevOps pricing options for open source projects, small teams, and teams of all sizes.",
