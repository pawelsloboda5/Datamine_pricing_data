We love the scheduling, the reports, instant invoicing and credit card charging, great for employees in the field, they can clearly see the job notes, add pictures to the client\u2019s profile. We can clearly see job cost, the average job cost if we send different people. AND my favorite part is price increase or price adjustment. Increasing prices, it used to take us weeks! Now it took us 30 min to increase 74 clients.\n\n### Gosia Baran\n\n#### Helping Hands Cleaning Services\n\nFAQ\u2019s\n-----\n\n### Why does your software cost so much?\n\nWe get asked this question all the time.

It\u2019s designed to help you automate your business, boost revenue, and substantially elevate the trajectory of your business.\n\nThe truth is that technology should no longer be viewed as an expense. We\u2019re living in a time of digital transformation where technology is literally changing how businesses operate. MaidCentral provides the technology and artificial intelligence that your company needs to make more money.\n\nThe better question to ask yourself is what is it costing to not have MaidCentral?
