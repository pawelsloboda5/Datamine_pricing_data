All you need is your email address.\n\nYou will have the option to upgrade to a paid account at anytime.\n\nWhich pricing plan is best for me?\n\n![Image 158](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nIf you have under 10 units and no employees, the Starter plan could be a good fit. We would recommend the Pro plan for 10+ units, and then the Premium plan for anyone who needs unlimited flexibility and customization with our API and integrations.\n\nHow will monthly billing work?\n\n![Image 159](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nYou can select to pay monthly for any of our plans (pay as you go). If you remove any units in the middle of the month, they will automatically be removed from your next monthly bill.\n\nYou can add more units anytime during the month, and it will be prorated based on how many days are left until your next bill. For example, if you add more units, and you are 20 days into your subscription, you will only be charged for 10 more days.\n\nHow will annual billing work?\n\n![Image 160](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nChoose to pay annually for our plans and get up to 20% off, billed upfront for 12 months. For example, if you add 10 units on the basic plan, it would cost $708 upfront for the entire year ($69 x 12 months).\n\nAny units you add will be prorated to your annual bill. For example, if you add an additional 20 units 3 months into your subscription, you\u2019ll only be charged for the remaining 9 months at the monthly rate difference ($20/month difference x 9 months).\n\nWhat are the value-add differences per plan?\n\n![Image 161](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nOn the Pro plan, you get decreased costs for the value-add services. On the Premium plan, many of the costs are waived.\n\n\u200d  \nBelow is the full comparison between plans:\n\n\u200d  \n\u200d**Starter:**\n\n*   $49 per merchant application\n*   $3 per Document\n*   $2.49 per ACH payment\n*   Your own website for $99 monthly plus $199 setup fee (or $999/year)\n*   $45 for background checks\n*   Chat support and one onboarding session\n\n\u200d**Pro:**\n\n*   $25 per merchant application\n*   $1 per Document\n*   $0.99 per ACH payment\n*   Your own website for $49 monthly plus $199 setup fee (or $499/year)\n*   $35 for background checks\n*   Chat and scheduled phone and zoom support with a tailored onboarding experience  \n    \n\n\u200d**Premium:**\n\n*   Free merchant apps\n*   Free Document eSignature\n*   Free incoming ACH payments\n*   Ability to charge ACH fees to generate more revenue\n*   Your own free website\n*   $25 for background checks\n*   Chat and scheduled phone and zoom support with a tailored onboarding experience  \n    \n*   VIP priority support\n\nAre there any contracts?\n\n![Image 162](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nWe believe you should have the freedom to use any software you like without being tied down by corporate contracts. With DoorLoop, you are free to cancel your account at any time or export your data and use another software.\n\nWhy is your price so low?\n\n![Image 163](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nWe are a privately owned company that is able to keep a low overhead and pass those savings onto you. By comparison, many of our competitors are publicly traded and need to charge high fees to please their shareholders.\n\nWhy do some companies hide their price or have no free trials?\n\n![Image 164](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nWhile we can\u2019t speak for all companies, in our experience they don\u2019t show the price on their sites because they either negotiate heavily so you will never know if you\u2019re getting the best deal, or because their price is so expensive they need to convince you over the phone why it\u2019s worth it (while employing high-pressure sales tactics).\n\nIf they don\u2019t allow you to try their software for free and want you to only schedule a demo, it\u2019s most likely because they know the software is so complex and hard to use, you will be lost without extensive training. The problem is, every time you hire someone new, they need to go through hours and hours of training. We\u2019re doing our best to change this industry and eliminate the need for long training and tech support calls by offering the easiest to use platform. We strongly believe you should be able to try before you buy, do your own research without being forced to get a demo and be pressured by a salesperson, and cancel anytime without penalty.\n\nWho funds online rent, screening, eSign services?\n\n![Image 165](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nThere are two premium services you can offer your tenants at **_no cost to you._**\n\n**Tenant Screening (by TransUnion)**: The cost to your prospective tenants is only $45 on the Starter plan, $35 on the Pro, and $25 on the Premium. It includes a US national criminal background check, eviction history, and credit report. You can also markup the cost and keep any profits.\n\n**Credit Card and ACH Payments (by Stripe)**: Automate your rent collection with a one-time setup fee of $49 per bank account on the Starter plan, $25 on the Pro, and free on the Premium.\n\nYour tenants pay a 3.25% platform fee for credit card payments or $2.49 for ACH ($1 on the Pro plan and free on the Premium plan). All fees are disclosed to tenants upfront for transparency.\n\n**Other benefits include:**\n\n1.  **Outgoing EFT payments:** $0.99 each under the Pro and Premium plans. You can also mail checks for $1.79.\n2.  **eSignatures**: $1 per document regardless of how many people need to sign.\n\nHow much money am I losing by not using DoorLoop?\n\n![Image 166](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nSticking to old methods carries an \u201copportunity cost.\u201d DoorLoop brings efficiency, letting you grow without increasing overhead. If you're exploring property management software, measure the following:\n\n1.  Tenant turnover costs\n2.  Missed rent revenue\n3.  Overhead growth with added units\n4.  Clients lost to competitors\n5.  Costs of vacancies and poor marketing\n6.  Time spent on tenant issues and maintenance\n\nHaving faced these issues ourselves, we refined our processes and integrated these solutions into DoorLoop. Many members say the software pays for itself through the automatic late fee collection alone!\n\nCan I migrate my data to DoorLoop?\n\n![Image 167](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624380709031623bfe4aee60/624380709031625d694aee83_icon_chevron.svg)\n\nYes.
