Every time a visitor comes to your site or app, we\u2019ll capture their journey and how they interact with your page. Sessions can be analyzed on heatmaps, funnels, replays, charts, dashboards, and more. Sessions end after 30 minutes of inactivity.\n\n### How many sessions do I need?\n\nSelect a plan that allows you to **capture every session on your site**. Compare to your existing analytics to estimate the number of sessions needed. Otherwise, once you reach the monthly sessions purchased on our Growth plans, you won\u2019t be able to get more session data before the next month.\n\n### What are replays?\n\nSession Replay reconstructs an individual visitor session on your site or app. It allows you to watch how users interact with your content, such as where they click, hover, swipe, and see potential issues.\n\n### Can I have multiple sites within one account?\n\nYes, you can. You can have as many sites as you need under one account. Please note that the plan you choose, including sessions and responses, will be available for all the sites. For the Free or Growth plans, these sessions and responses will be divided equally between sites. For example, if you select 10k sessions and you have 2 sites, each site will get 5k sessions. You should choose a number of sessions and/or responses that work for all your sites.\n\nPlease note that for Pro and Enterprise, this does not apply.\n\n### Can I have a trial?\n\nYes, every new account starts with a **free trial** of our Growth plans. There are no auto-charges, and you don't need to input any payment details. After the 15-day trial period, you can choose which plans you want (or continue with the free ones).\n\n### What happens if I reach the session or response limit?\n\nEach plan comes with a pre-defined number of sessions or responses that automatically resets each month.\n\nIf you reach the session limit on our Free and Growth plans:\n\n*   You won't get any new heatmap or funnel data until next month's reset date.\n    \n\nIf you reach the response limit for Voice of the Customer:\n\n*   Your surveys and widgets will no longer be sent, so you won\u2019t be getting new responses until next month\u2019s reset date.\n    \n\nTo avoid lost data, you can upgrade by adding more sessions or responses or even to a new plan (with more and new features!).\n\nBilling questions\n-----------------\n\n### What currencies does Contentsquare accept?\n\nContentsquare's Growth plans for European customers will be billed in Euros (applicable to the European continent; for example, the UK is billed in Euros), while customers outside of this region will be billed in US dollars.\n\n### What's the commitment?\n\nOur growth plans do not require an annual contract. If you choose to pay monthly, you can cancel your subscription at any time by downgrading to the free Basic plan.\n\nIf you choose to downgrade, the new plan will only become effective after the end of the current monthly subscription.\n\n### Are the prices per site?\n\nNo, the prices are for your entire account within one geographic region (e.g., North America vs. Europe, etc.), no matter how many sites you have under the same account. So, any plan you choose (including sessions and responses) will be applied to all your sites within the region. We recommend you select a plan and number of sessions and responses that cover your needs.\n\n### Do you offer yearly price plans? Or bundle discounts?\n\nYes to both. You can pay for your plans annually. When annual payment is set up in-app with a credit card or PayPal, a 20% discount before VAT is added to your bill. Note that this discount is not applicable when paying by invoice.\n\nAlso, we offer a 10% discount on the lowest selected plan when you subscribe to two paid, Growth tier plans (i.e. a paid plan on our Digital Experience Analytics Growth product, and a paid plan on our Voice of Customer Growth product). This applies on top of the 20% discount on annual plans.\n\n### How do the yearly and package discounts work?\n\nWe offer two discount types when paying for our Growth tier plans in-app using a credit card or PayPal:\n\n*   A 20% discount when you pay for your subscription yearly.\n    \n\n*   A 10% discount on the lowest plan when you subscribe to two Growth tier plans (e.g. a paid plan on our Experience Analytics product, and a paid plan on our Voice of Customer product)\n    \n\nPlease note that these discounts are only applicable to in-app payments. Payments made through a manual invoice are not eligible for either discount.\n\n### What payment methods do you support?\n\nFor monthly or yearly payments, we support all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, Maestro, and Discover) and PayPal.\n\n### What\u2019s the cancellation policy?\n\nAll new Growth plan accounts have a 30-day-money-back guarantee. Cancel within 30 days and you\u2019ll receive a full refund.\n\nIf you cancel a Growth plan after 30 days you\u2019ll be charged up until the end of the current billing cycle. For customers on a monthly contract, that will be a month after your last payment. For customers on an annual contract, that will be a year after your last payment.\n\nRemember, you never need to delete your account completely. You can cancel the Growth plan subscription but continue to have access to our Free plan. You\u2019ll simply move down to our forever Free plan.\n\nWant to become a Hotjar partner?\n--------------------------------\n\nIntroduce your clients to Hotjar and earn up to 25% recurring revenue
