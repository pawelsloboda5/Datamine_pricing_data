It\u2019s not a trial and it\u2019s free forever. Wistia\u2019s Free Plan comes with 10 videos, 200 GB of bandwidth per month, basic analytics, and the ability to customize the player to match the look and feel of your brand.\n    \n*   #### What\u2019s the difference between included media and the total media limit?\n    \n    Included media is a little bit, well\u2026literal! It\u2019s the number of video or audio files you can upload to Wistia at no extra charge (i.e., what\u2019s included on your plan). Once you\u2019ve hit your included media limit, you can still upload audio or video files to Wistia\u2014for a small additional cost. The total media limit? This one refers to the maximum number of video or audio files you can upload to Wistia on any plan.\n    \n*   #### What counts as a \u201cmedia file\u201d?\n    \n    Any file you upload counts as a media file. We suggest sticking to video and audio.\n    \n*   #### I want to add more team members to Wistia. Can I purchase additional users?\n    \n    The best way to unlock additional users is by upgrading your Wistia plan. We\u2019ve carefully designed our plans to align with various phases of your video journey. If you need to add more collaborators to your Wistia account, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll benefit from what\u2019s available on the next tier up\u2014things like higher media limits and more sophisticated reporting. It\u2019s also important to note that you can share view-only links to your audio and video content with anyone.\n    \n*   #### Will I be charged for bandwidth?\n    \n    We don\u2019t want you to have to worry about bandwidth. That\u2019s why each plan has a clear bandwidth limit. Our Free Plan includes 200 GB per month, which should be more than enough for 10 uploads. If you\u2019re on a Plus, Pro, or Advanced Plan, you\u2019ll have a bandwidth limit of 1 TB per month. And finally, if you\u2019re on our Premium Plan, you\u2019ll have custom bandwidth coverage. If you ever exceed your bandwidth limit, we\u2019ll notify you and offer you the option to upgrade your plan to one with a higher bandwidth limit. For more information, [check out our support doc on bandwidth](https://wistia.com/support/account-and-billing/bandwidth \"Link opens in a new tab\") or [get in touch with us](https://wistia.com/pricing/getintouch \"Link opens in a new tab\").\n    \n*   #### Do you have any file size restrictions?\n    \n    Wistia plays best with **MP4 files** with an **h.264 codec**, a bitrate between **5,000\u201310,000 kbps**, and a maximum file size of **26 GB**. If your file doesn\u2019t fit within these guidelines, try running the file through [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/ \"Link opens in a new tab\") (a free transcoding software) to see if that resolves the problem.\n    \n*   #### Can I purchase features a-la-carte?\n    \n    We hate to be a bummer, but you can\u2019t purchase features a-la-carte. We\u2019ve carefully designed our plans to align with different phases of your video journey. If you want a specific feature, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll benefit from what\u2019s on the next tier up\u2014like higher media limits, more collaborators, and more sophisticated reporting.\n    \n*   #### Can I cancel at any time?\n    \n    Yes, you can cancel at any time unless you have a signed contract or order form with us. If you elect to cancel a paid plan during your billing cycle, you will not be issued a refund.\n    \n\nReady to take Wistia for a spin?\n--------------------------------\n\nStart for free.

It\u2019s not a trial and it\u2019s free forever. Wistia\u2019s Free Plan comes with 10 videos, 200 GB of bandwidth per month, basic analytics, and the ability to customize the player to match the look and feel of your brand.\n    \n*   #### What\u2019s the difference between included media and the total media limit?\n    \n    Included media is a little bit, well\u2026literal! It\u2019s the number of video or audio files you can upload to Wistia at no extra charge (i.e., what\u2019s included on your plan). Once you\u2019ve hit your included media limit, you can still upload audio or video files to Wistia\u2014for a small additional cost. The total media limit? This one refers to the maximum number of video or audio files you can upload to Wistia on any plan.\n    \n*   #### What counts as a \u201cmedia file\u201d?\n    \n    Any file you upload counts as a media file. We suggest sticking to video and audio.\n    \n*   #### I want to add more team members to Wistia. Can I purchase additional users?\n    \n    The best way to unlock additional users is by upgrading your Wistia plan. We\u2019ve carefully designed our plans to align with various phases of your video journey. If you need to add more collaborators to your Wistia account, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll benefit from what\u2019s available on the next tier up\u2014things like higher media limits and more sophisticated reporting. It\u2019s also important to note that you can share view-only links to your audio and video content with anyone.\n    \n*   #### Will I be charged for bandwidth?\n    \n    We don\u2019t want you to have to worry about bandwidth. That\u2019s why each plan has a clear bandwidth limit. Our Free Plan includes 200 GB per month, which should be more than enough for 10 uploads. If you\u2019re on a Plus, Pro, or Advanced Plan, you\u2019ll have a bandwidth limit of 1 TB per month. And finally, if you\u2019re on our Premium Plan, you\u2019ll have custom bandwidth coverage. If you ever exceed your bandwidth limit, we\u2019ll notify you and offer you the option to upgrade your plan to one with a higher bandwidth limit. For more information, [check out our support doc on bandwidth](https://wistia.com/support/account-and-billing/bandwidth \"Link opens in a new tab\") or [get in touch with us](https://wistia.com/pricing/getintouch \"Link opens in a new tab\").\n    \n*   #### Do you have any file size restrictions?\n    \n    Wistia plays best with **MP4 files** with an **h.264 codec**, a bitrate between **5,000\u201310,000 kbps**, and a maximum file size of **26 GB**. If your file doesn\u2019t fit within these guidelines, try running the file through [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/ \"Link opens in a new tab\") (a free transcoding software) to see if that resolves the problem.\n    \n*   #### Can I purchase features a-la-carte?\n    \n    We hate to be a bummer, but you can\u2019t purchase features a-la-carte. We\u2019ve carefully designed our plans to align with different phases of your video journey. If you want a specific feature, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll benefit from what\u2019s on the next tier up\u2014like higher media limits, more collaborators, and more sophisticated reporting.\n    \n*   #### Can I cancel at any time?\n    \n    Yes, you can cancel at any time unless you have a signed contract or order form with us. If you elect to cancel a paid plan during your billing cycle, you will not be issued a refund.\n    \n\nReady to take Wistia for a spin?\n--------------------------------\n\nStart for free.
