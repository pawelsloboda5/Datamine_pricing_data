To pay for your plan you can enter your credit card details on the subscription page in your account.\n\n[**When is my credit card charged for my plan subscription?** ![Image 32: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://www.teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nWe bill your credit card after the end of each month based on your usage during the month. If you sign up part way through a month your first invoice will pro-rate the cost for the remaining time in the month.\n\n[**What are the \"student lessons\" mentioned in the plan prices?** ![Image 33: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://www.teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nThe monthly subscription includes a fee based on the number of lessons in the month. Lessons are counted based on the number of students, so a lesson with 1 student is 1 student lesson, a lesson with 2 students is two student lessons, etc. This count excludes cancelled lessons.\n\n[**Are there any setup or cancellation fees?** ![Image 34: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://www.teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nNo, there aren't any fees other than the monthly fee.\n\n[**What if I want to cancel my account?** ![Image 35: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://www.teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nTeachworks has no contracts so you can cancel your account at any time.\n\n[**What currency is used for the subscription fees above?** ![Image 36: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://www.teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nSubscription fees are charged in US Dollars.\n\n[**What Is The Fair Usage Policy For Emails?** ![Image 37: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://www.teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nEach of our plans include \u201cUnlimited Emails\u201d, however, a fair usage policy applies to bulk emails. Transactional emails have no limit.\n\nTransactional emails include emails related to lessons, billing, payroll, package balances, cancellations etc. Teachworks allows your company to send as many transactional emails as needed, based on your level of activity (i.e. the number of lessons you schedule each month).\n\nBulk emails refer to marketing, promotional or other informational emails that are sent to recipients using our Email Add-on. If your company sends a high volume of these emails relative to your lessons per month, additional fees may apply.\n\nWe calculate fair usage as 1 bulk email per student lesson per month and there is no additional charge for this volume. For example, if you have 1,000 student lessons per month, you can send up to 1,000 bulk emails with now additional charge. Email volume above the fair usage limit will have a charge of $1 per 1,000 emails.\n\n[![Image 38: Up chevron](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/6123a2bea3ad0d1ca938575d_up.svg)](https://www.teachworks.com/pricing#top)\n\nThe ultimate starting point for businesses wanting to excel online.

To pay for your plan you can enter your credit card details on the subscription page in your account.\n\n[**When is my credit card charged for my plan subscription?** ![Image 32: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nWe bill your credit card after the end of each month based on your usage during the month. If you sign up part way through a month your first invoice will pro-rate the cost for the remaining time in the month.\n\n[**What are the \"student lessons\" mentioned in the plan prices?** ![Image 33: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nThe monthly subscription includes a fee based on the number of lessons in the month. Lessons are counted based on the number of students, so a lesson with 1 student is 1 student lesson, a lesson with 2 students is two student lessons, etc. This count excludes cancelled lessons.\n\n[**Are there any setup or cancellation fees?** ![Image 34: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nNo, there aren't any fees other than the monthly fee.\n\n[**What if I want to cancel my account?** ![Image 35: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nTeachworks has no contracts so you can cancel your account at any time.\n\n[**What currency is used for the subscription fees above?** ![Image 36: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nSubscription fees are charged in US Dollars.\n\n[**What Is The Fair Usage Policy For Emails?** ![Image 37: Decorative Chevron Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/601a133b7386741f6316092f_Chevron.svg)](https://teachworks.com/pricing#)\n\nEach of our plans include \u201cUnlimited Emails\u201d, however, a fair usage policy applies to bulk emails. Transactional emails have no limit.\n\nTransactional emails include emails related to lessons, billing, payroll, package balances, cancellations etc. Teachworks allows your company to send as many transactional emails as needed, based on your level of activity (i.e. the number of lessons you schedule each month).\n\nBulk emails refer to marketing, promotional or other informational emails that are sent to recipients using our Email Add-on. If your company sends a high volume of these emails relative to your lessons per month, additional fees may apply.\n\nWe calculate fair usage as 1 bulk email per student lesson per month and there is no additional charge for this volume. For example, if you have 1,000 student lessons per month, you can send up to 1,000 bulk emails with now additional charge. Email volume above the fair usage limit will have a charge of $1 per 1,000 emails.\n\n[![Image 38: Up chevron](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/601a133a769fa8f8d45d95ba/6123a2bea3ad0d1ca938575d_up.svg)](https://teachworks.com/pricing#top)\n\nThe ultimate starting point for businesses wanting to excel online.
