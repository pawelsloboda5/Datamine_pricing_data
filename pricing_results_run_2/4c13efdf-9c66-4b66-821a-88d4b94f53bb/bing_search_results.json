This includes tasks like generating API keys, creating OAuth apps,\u00a0monitoring the developer console, and managing webhook configurations.\n\nHow does API pricing work?\n\n**Free Sandbox:**\u00a0This plan is for testing our APIs. You can integrate our APIs into your application for free. However, the documents created will be watermarked as \u201cThis is a test document\u201d and automatically deleted after 14 days.\n\n**Enterprise API:**\u00a0The Enterprise API pricing starts from $30/month, includes 40 signature requests. Once you\u2019ve used the 40 signature requests, a pay-as-you-go plan will get started, costing $0.75 per signature request.\n\n**Custom Plan:**\u00a0We also provide customized pricing options to fit your unique needs.\n\nPlease refer to this link for more information about API pricing:\u00a0[BoldSign API Pricing](https://www.boldsign.com/electronic-signature-pricing/?plan=api)\n\nHow are signature requests counted?\n\nYou will be charged per envelope sent for signature. You can add multiple documents within a single envelope, and they will be considered as one signature request.\n\nCan I test BoldSign's API?\n\nYes, you can test BoldSign\u2019s API with the free Sandbox plan. Remember, documents created with this plan will be watermarked, and deleted after 14 days.\n\nWill my documents be secure?\n\nYes, documents created with BoldSign are entirely secure. Your data is protected so that even our staff cannot access it for troubleshooting purposes. Please refer to this link for more information: [BoldSign security policy](https://www.boldsign.com/security-policy/).\n\nWhich plan is best for me and my team?\n\nCheck out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj5SWTOJdWM) to compare our different paid plans and select the one that best fits your needs.\n\nAvailable as an add-on: $5 per custom email domain. One free custom email domain is included in the plan.\n\n### Company Overview\n\n![Image 86: Developers](https://website-static.boldsign.com/2024/04/0a6b50cb-developers.webp)\n\nDevelopers\n\n0 M+\n\n![Image 87: Companies](https://website-static.boldsign.com/2024/04/0b359eab-companies.webp)\n\nCompanies\n\n0 K+\n\n![Image 88: Years in business](https://website-static.boldsign.com/2024/04/8feee04d-years-in-business.webp)\n\nYears in business\n\n0 +\n\n![Image 89: Fortune 500 companies](https://website-static.boldsign.com/2024/04/901f0017-fortune-500-companies.webp)\n\nFortune 500 companies\n\n0 +\n\nTestimonials\n\nWhy our customers love us\n\nWe\u2019re using BoldSign successfully in our b2b SaaS platform - as it\u2019s embedded to allow seasonal farm workers and their agribusiness employers to e-sign their employment onboarding documents for the first time.
