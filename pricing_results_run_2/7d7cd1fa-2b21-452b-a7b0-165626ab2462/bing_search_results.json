For example, a 160 character message to 50 people would account for 50 credits. Longer messages can be sent too - they simply use additional credits as required.\n\n#### Do credits expire?\n\nNo, credits can be used when it's good for you. This allows you to tailor your campaigns to your audience. Simply use your account only once in a 12 month period to keep your account active.\n\n#### Do I have to sign a long term contract?\n\nNo. There are no long term contracts or commitments on your part.
