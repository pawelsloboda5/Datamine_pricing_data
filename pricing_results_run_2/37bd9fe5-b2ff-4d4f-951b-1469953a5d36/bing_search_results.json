Nutshell comes standard with unlimited CRM contacts and no data limits. Email marketing subscriptions require an additional monthly charge based on your number of marketable contacts. Foundation does have a limit of 100 open leads.\n    \n*   ### How can I import my contacts into Nutshell?\n    \n    Getting your people into Nutshell from any source is simple\u2014just put your contacts into a CSV file, select the appropriate Nutshell fields, and import away! We have a\u00a0[helpful video](https://support.nutshell.com/en/articles/8429106-import-how-to-import-your-contacts-to-nutshell)\u00a0that walks through the process, or you can\u00a0[reach out to our support team](https://www.nutshell.com/contact)\u00a0for assistance.\n    \n*   ### So what\u2019s a \u201cmarketing contact\u201d?\n    \n    Great question! A\u00a0**marketing contact**\u00a0is a person in Nutshell that has at least one email address and hasn\u2019t unsubscribed from your communications or bounced from previous outreach.\n    \n*   ### Will I need IT to implement Nutshell?\n    \n    Only if you spill your coffee on your keyboard. Nutshell is an out-of-the-box, cloud-based tool, so there\u2019s no need to get the techies involved. And that means you can use it from anywhere, too.\n    \n*   ### Does Nutshell work on my mobile phone or tablet?\n    \n    You bet it does. If you have an iPhone or Android phone, we offer apps that you can download for free in the\u00a0[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nutshell-small-business-crm/id337938121)\u00a0or\u00a0[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutshell.crm&hl=en).\n    \n    If you use a tablet (like an iPad or Surface), Nutshell is responsively designed to work smoothly from your browser.\n    \n*   ### Does Nutshell work with my email?\n    \n    Yep. Nutshell works with all email providers and clients, including Google and Outlook. You\u2019ll never have to worry about your email not syncing with Nutshell.\n    \n*   ### What do I do if I need help?\n    \n    [Just contact us!](https://www.nutshell.com/contact) We\u2019ve got you covered. We think that every single user\u2014whether you\u2019re just getting started with your trial or you\u2019re a longtime customer\u2014deserves helpful support.\n    \n*   ### Why isn\u2019t there an annual payment option for Email marketing?\n    \n    It\u2019s hard to predict how many marketing contacts a growing business will gain over the course of a year. Instead of asking our customers to predict how many contacts they\u00a0_think_ they\u2019ll need during an annual subscription, we think it\u2019s easier to charge Email marketing users month-to-month, so you can increase your contact limit as needed.\n    \n*   ### I\u2019m not paying for Email marketing, and yet I seem to have access to it in my Nutshell account. What\u2019s going on here?\n    \n    Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re just giving you a little taste on the house. Nutshell customers can still send 150 delivered marketing emails per month (including test messages), even without a paid subscription.\n    \n    With a paid Nutshell email marketing subscription, your team has a monthly send limit equal to 8X your contact limit.\n    \n\n[Load More](https://www.nutshell.com/pricing#)\n\n#### See Nutshell in action!\n\nTry Nutshell free for 14 days or let us show you around before you dive in.\n\n[free trial](https://app.nutshell.com/signup) [contact sales](https://www.nutshell.com/contact)\n\n![Image 227](blob:http://localhost/3a14df61f2cf9cdc6b8233a2076ad2b2)\n\n![Image 229](blob:http://localhost/d25d30238079b6bc9fdf6a6965099246)\n\n### See Nutshell in Action\n\n**Today\u2019s live demo is starting soon!** Register now for an introduction to our award-winning CRM.\n\n*   Days\n*   Hours\n*   Minutes\n*   Seconds\n\n[Register Now](https://www.nutshell.com/guided-tours/intro-to-nutshell)\n\n### See Nutshell in Action\n\n**Today\u2019s live demo is starting soon!** Register now for an introduction to our award-winning CRM.\n\n*   Days\n*   Hours\n*   Minutes\n*   Seconds\n\n[Register Now](https://www.nutshell.com/guided-tours/intro-to-nutshell)\n\n### See Nutshell in Action\n\n**Today\u2019s live demo is starting soon!** Register now for an introduction to our award-winning CRM.\n\n*   Days\n*   Hours\n*   Minutes\n*   Seconds\n\n[Register Now](https://www.nutshell.com/guided-tours/intro-to-nutshell)\n\nJoin 30,000+ other sales and marketing professionals.
