The more you grow, the more you pay. It's discouraging and it never ends. What if you could turn this around?\n\nMeet Sendy\n----------\n\nSendy is a self hosted email newsletter application that lets you send bulk emails via Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). You only pay for what you send, at only $1 per 10,000 emails. No longer will you be held hostage by increasing monthly fees as your subscriber base flourishes.\n\n### Also works natively with these SMTP providers\n\n [![Image 19: Sendgrid](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/sendgrid.png)](https://sendgrid.com/ \"Sendgrid\")[![Image 20: Mailjet](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/mailjet.png)](https://mailjet.com/ \"Mailjet\")[![Image 21: Elastic Email](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/elastic-email.png)](https://elasticemail.com/ \"Elastic Email\")\n\n![Image 22: Sendy report](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/hero-small.jpg)\n\nNumber of subscribers\n\nNo limits\n\nMonthly fee\n\n$0\n\nOne time fee\n\n$69\n\nCost per 10,000 emails\n\n$1\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Features you'll get\n----------------------\n\n[![Image 23: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature1.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### Send newsletters 100x cheaper\n\nWith Sendy, you no longer pay increasingly expensive monthly fees. Pay only when you send at the incredibly low rate of $1 per 10,000 emails. Sendy not only sends your emails quickly via Amazon SES, you also enjoy high deliverability rates. Best bang for your buck!\n\n[![Image 24: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature2.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### Beautiful reports\n\nSee results of every campaign and autoresponders in a beautifully formatted report. Visualize opens, clicks, bounces, complaints and countries with charts & data. You can export segments of subscribers from your report for re-targetting.\n\n[![Image 25: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature3.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### White labeled client accounts\n\nManaging multiple products or services? With Sendy, you can organize them into groups or as we like to call it, 'brands'. Optionally give your client access to their own brand and let them send newsletters on their own at a price you set. You can even set monthly sending limits and adjust client privileges.\n\n[![Image 26: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature4.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### Autoresponders\n\nAutomate your marketing by setting up a series of emails in drip campaigns to automatically follow up with your subscribers at time intervals you set. Or send emails annually or one off emails at a specific date. Keep your subscribers engaged and your brand at the top of their mind.\n\n[![Image 27: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature5.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### List segmentation\n\nResearch shows sending emails to targeted segments can increase email engagement as well as revenue by more than 25%. Sendy enables you to create segments for any list based on any conditions you define. Choose segments and/or lists to include or exclude in your email campaigns for optimized results.\n\n[![Image 28: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature6.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### Rules & Webhooks\n\nDecide what happens when something happens - by creating 'Rules'. For example, setup a rule to get notified by email when a scheduled campaign starts sending, trigger a webhook when an autoresponder is sent, unsubscribe someone from a list when they're signed up to another, and so on.\n\n[![Image 29: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature7.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### List & subscriber management\n\nManage and segment lists & subscribers easily with Sendy. Mass import/delete subscribers, custom fields, single/double opt-in, custom subscribe/unsubscribe confirmation page, thank you/good bye emails, subscribe form or API to add users (takes a deep breath), you name it!\n\n[![Image 30: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature8.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### Custom fields\n\nCreate custom fields to store more than just 'name' and 'email'. Not only can you store more information about your subscribers, you can use them for list segmentation or personalization tags in your newsletters for a more personalized experience.\n\n[![Image 31: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature9.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### Bounce & complaint handling\n\nKeep your lists clean effortlessly as bounces, complaints and unsubscribes are automatically handled in real time once your newsletter is sent. There is no need for any manual post campaign cleanups, just sit back and watch your campaign report unfold.\n\n[![Image 32: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature10.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### Custom domains\n\nSetup custom domains so that unsubscribe, web version and trackable links will use the domain you prefer, rather than the URL where you installed Sendy. Recipients will be better able to recognize who you are, resulting in lower complaint rates.\n\n[![Image 33: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature11.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### Housekeeping\n\nHaving thousands of unconfirmed email addresses from double opt-in signups that serves no purpose in your lists? As well as people who had never ever read or engage in your emails? You can clean them off your list with just a click of a button.\n\n[![Image 34: Amazon Web Services](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature12.jpg)](https://sendy.co/#)\n\n### Third party integrations & Zapier\n\nSendy integrates with popular apps like WordPress, Magento, Joomla etc thanks to third party developers. Sendy also works with Zapier, an automation service that enables you to integrate Sendy with thousands of apps in Zapier's app directory!\n\n### Send email newsletters via Amazon SES to any lists or segments\n\n![Image 35](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss1.jpg)\n\n### Visualize your campaigns in a beautiful report\n\n![Image 36](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss2.jpg)\n\n### Create multiple 'brands' and optionally give your client access\n\n![Image 37](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss3.jpg)\n\n### Setup autoresponders and engage with your subscribers effortlessly\n\n![Image 38](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss4.jpg)\n\n### Create segments of your list and send targeted emails\n\n![Image 39](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss5.jpg)\n\n### Decide what happens when something happens with Rules & Webhooks\n\n![Image 40](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss6.jpg)\n\n### Effortlessly manage lists and subscribers\n\n![Image 41](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss7.jpg)\n\n### Create custom fields, then use them for personalization tags or segmentation\n\n![Image 42](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss8.jpg)\n\n### Bounces, complaints and unsubscribes are automatically handled in real time\n\n![Image 43](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss9.jpg)\n\n### Setup custom domains for each brand you own\n\n![Image 44](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss10.jpg)\n\n### Keep your list clean and lean\n\n![Image 45](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss11.jpg)\n\n### Integrate Sendy with other apps\n\n![Image 46](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/feature-ss12.jpg)\n\n\ud83e\udd0d What people are saying\n-------------------------\n\n![Image 47: User - John Gruber](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-john.jpg)\n\nJohn Gruber from [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) @gruber\n\n![Image 48: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\n@getSendy Thank \\*you\\* for making good software.\n\n![Image 49: User - Cabel](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-cabel.jpg)\n\nCabel from [Panic](https://panic.com/) @cabel\n\n![Image 50: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\nOur list is over 500k at this point and we\u2019ve since switched to a self-install of \u201cSendy\u201d and I absolutely love it. We pay very little to Amazon SES to deliver the emails and Sendy is a one-time purchase.\n\n![Image 51: User - Kalob Taulien](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-kalob.jpg)\n\nKalob Taulien @KalobTaulien\n\n![Image 52: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\nI use Sendy. Been using it for a number of years, it's GREAT and reliable. I've probs sent thousands of dollars worth of emails over the years. Very much worth the $69 one-time cost imo.\n\n![Image 53: User - Matt Spurrier](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-matt.jpg)\n\nMatt Spurrier @DigitalSparky\n\n![Image 54: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\nI personally use Sendy, a relatively cheap PHP web application that uses Amazon SES for mailout. Works great for me and you only ever pay the license for the software and on-demand for the emails, as opposed to paying the monthly fee for 'subscribers'\n\n![Image 55: User - David Schwertfeger](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-dschwertfeger.jpg)\n\nDavid Schwertfeger @dschwertfeger\n\n![Image 56: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\nWhen I looked at ESPs months ago it seemed crazy to me to pay a monthly fee based on your number of subscribers\u2026\n\nEven if I don't send a single email.\n\nSendy uses Amazon SES to send emails 100x cheaper.\n\n![Image 57: User - Adam Fortuna](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-adam.jpg)\n\nAdam Fortuna @adamfortuna\n\n![Image 58: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\nThe first is Sendy (@getSendy) which we use for our newsletter. I used Sendy on @minafiblog for the last few years and loved it.\n\nIf you're sending newsletters, it's soooo much cheaper than anything else with a great delivery rate. 3/x\n\n![Image 59: User - Jonathan W Thomas](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-jonathan.jpg)\n\njonathanwthomas @jonathanwthomas\n\n![Image 60: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\nI \u2018rolled my own\u2019 using @getSendy and Amazon SES. I spend maybe $20 a month on email now and have great deliverability because it\u2019s Amazon. I have 60k subscribers. Was paying almost $300 a month with Mailchimp. Never going back.\n\n![Image 61: User - Dylan Malone](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-dylan.jpg)\n\nDylan Malone @dylanmalone\n\n![Image 62: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\n@tvaziri I have strong opinions on this one! Use this, or have one of your many developer friends host it for you using this: https://sendy.co\n\nIt's literally 100x cheaper than MailChimp et al. Those email services really are overcharging. I'm all for a fair profit, but wow.\n\n![Image 63: User - Richard Lee](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-richard.jpg)\n\nRichard Lee @dlackty\n\n![Image 64: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\nJust upgraded our @getSendy installation to v6. We used Sendy since v1 and every major version upgrades are impressive. It\u2019s worth every penny!\n\n![Image 65: User - Liam Gill](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-liam.jpg)\n\nLiam Gill @LawyerLiam\n\n![Image 66: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\nQuick shout out to the team @getSendy. I posted last week about how I had lost my subscriber list. Their team was instrumental in helping mitigate the damage and get me back up and running again. Highly recommend to any founder with a newsletter!\n\n![Image 67: User - Pankaj Kumar](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-pankaj.jpg)\n\nPankaj Kumar @PankajWebDev\n\n![Image 68: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\nAfter using MailChimp for 4 years, I shifted to @getSendy and it's just awesome. Already saved thousands of dollars and it's Just Awesome! It's a must for serious email marketers having a huge subscriber base.\n\n![Image 69: User - Nicole](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-nicole.jpg)\n\nnicole @techmomogy\n\n![Image 70: X / Twitter logo](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/twitter-x-logo.jpg)\n\n1000% recommend @getSendy for #newsletters. So incredibly impressed with this app. Even if you need them or someone else to install on your servers, completely worth it.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 FAQs\n-------\n\n### Is this a hosted service?\n\nNo. Sendy is a self hosted application that runs on your web server. Pay once and it's yours, there's no recurring fee.\n\n### What are the requirements?\n\nYou'd install Sendy on an online Apache web server with Linux, PHP & MySQL support, just like WordPress! Almost all hosting companies support them.\n\n### Is Sendy easy to setup?\n\nIf FTP and MySQL database is familiar to you, yes. Just follow our [Get Started Guide](https://sendy.co/get-started) to get up and running. You can also opt for an installation service too if you need it.\n\n### Are updates free?\n\nUpdates are free up till the next major version, eg. version 7.x, 8.x etc. Major versions don't come so often, so you'd receive more new features in free minor versions than major ones.\n\n### What's SES send rate and limit?\n\nOnce signed up for Amazon SES, [request for your sending quota to be increased](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home#/account/request-production-access). Eg. if you need to send 50k emails daily, request Amazon for a sending quota of 50k emails per day.\n\n### Can I install Sendy on multiple domains?\n\nSendy can be installed on one domain per license. To install Sendy on more domains, you need additional licenses. However, you can use any 'From email' belonging to any domain to send emails in Sendy.\n\n### Are Sendy's files obfuscated?\n\nSendy's files are not obfuscated except for the installation and functions file. You can edit the source code for your own personal use without needing these two files.\n\n### What's with Sendy's low pricing?\n\nSendy is a self hosted app, you host it on your own web hosting server instead of ours, so you don\u2019t pay us monthly fees. Emails are sent via Amazon SES at a jaw dropping low rate of only $1 per 10,000 emails.\n\n\ud83d\uded2 Get your Sendy\n-----------------\n\n![Image 71: User - Ben Smith](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-ben-smith.jpg)\n\nBen Smith @bensmithcodes\n\nSuper impressed with @getSendy!

The interface is top notch, with subscribe forms, list management, tracking\u2026 and 10,000 emails for $1. ONE DOLLAR.\n\n![Image 73: User - Bogdan Nichovski](https://dlgo7qh09pizs.cloudfront.net/images/user-bogdan-nichovski.jpg)\n\nBogdan Nichovski @Nichovski\n\nYou should try sendy. It works great and it is super cheap. You just need to set up Amazon SES and you are ready to roll.\n\n  \n\n### Sendy is yours for a one time payment\n\nYou can then save a 100x for every campaign. But these savings are useless if your emails can't be delivered to the inbox. That is why Sendy uses Amazon SES to send your emails.\n\nIf you encounter problems, we will help you. If it doesn't work out, we'll refund you.\n\n### Sendy software\n\n$ 69 One time fee\n\n*   No monthly fees\n*   Download Sendy, install on your server.\n*   Follow the [Get Started Guide](https://sendy.co/get-started) to install Sendy\n\n Add installation service?\n\n$ 79 One time fee\n\nSit back while we setup Sendy for you! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nChoose an installation option below:\n\n*    **Option 1** Install Sendy on your existing Apache/Linux based web hosting server.
