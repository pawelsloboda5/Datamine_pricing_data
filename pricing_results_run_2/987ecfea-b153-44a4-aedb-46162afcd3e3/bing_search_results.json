      "content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\nWe build BirdSend specifically for Course Creators, Coaches, Consultants, Thought Leaders / Speakers, and bloggers \u2014 basically \"Content Creators\".\n\nIf you create content, show and teach your knowledge to others, YOU and BirdSend are a match made in heaven.\n\nAn individual or small business whose business involves creating content the majority of the time.\n\nContent can be in the form of text, audio, and video.\n\nSome examples of Content Creators: Course Creators, Coaches, Consultants, Thought Leaders / Speakers, and bloggers.\n\nIf you share or teach knowledge/information to others, you're a content creator.\n\nA content creator is bootstrapped and self-funded, and is typically a solopreneur or runs a tiny team of less than 10 team members.\n\n1/ You\u2019ll save 3 - 5X **every month**. This means up to **80% savings each month**.\n\n2/ You\u2019ll still get **high email open rates** / deliverability, despite our affordable pricing.\n\n3/ BirdSend is EXCLUSIVELY for Content Creators only, and not for everyone else. Other email tools are for everyone and anyone who wants to do email marketing.\n\nWe're a no-frills platform. We purposely don't have bells and whistles (which a content creator doesn't need) that bloat up the tool.\n\nThis means setting up email campaigns is **super quick and easy**. And fun too!\n\nWe challenge you to find an email marketing tool that's easier to use than us!\n\nYes of course! Not only that, but we also automatically track your email earnings out of the box \u2014 without cobbling up multiple 3rd party tools (and excel spreadsheets). We report back the ALTV (average lifetime value) of your subscribers based on any campaign(s) you want \u2014 automatically and instantly the moment you log in to your BirdSend account.\n\n2 Reasons:\n\n1/ We don't do any kind of paid ads.\n\nWe pass the savings to our customers. We primarily rely on word of mouth to drive new sign ups.\n\nAnd allocate the majority of our funds on product development to make sure the product is good. Otherwise no one would want to refer us to their network.\n\nYou CAN build a good quality product and provide good customer support while at the same time charging affordable prices. It's not mutually exclusive. You can have both.\n\n\\-\n\n2/ It's so affordable NOW because BirdSend is not as well known in the marketplace yet. Let's just say we got to the \"email marketing party\" late. We're the newcomer.\n\nWhen we get enough traction, we'll increase our pricing to reflect the level of quality BirdSend is at. The good news is that if you sign up for a paid plan now, you'll be locked in at the current rate. When we increase our price in the near future for new users, you'll get to keep your current rate.\n\nWe have a strict compliance process to weed out the bad eggs, so that only legit users can use our system. In fact, our compliance team has turned down numerous applications because they were not meeting the quality standard we're looking for.\n\nThe reason why it's so affordable now is because we\u2019re not yet as well known as our competitors. We're the newcomer, the \u201cDavid trying to fight Goliath\u201d.\n\nBecause of this, we'll work harder than them to win your trust and business now and in the future -- as we strive to become the #1 email marketing tool for content creators.\n\nYou can see what our users say about us throughout the site and on 3rd party review sites. You can also see we're constantly pushing new functionalities and enhancements to the tool via our [Updates Page](https://headwayapp.co/birdsend-updates).\n\nBecause we\u2019re self-funded and want to focus only on serious folks who\u2019re ready to pay.\n\nThis way we can (much) better serve paying customers instead of spreading our resources thin by serving free users too.\n\nAs you might have guessed, if we have a free plan, free users will hog the majority of our resources (human support, server and mailing usage, etc.)\n\nYes, you definitely can. And you don't need to reconfirm them.\n\nIf you go over the limit, we'll automatically bump you up to the next level plan.\n\nAbsolutely! There are no contracts, so you can cancel your account anytime you wish from within your account.\n\nYes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan anytime inside your account dashboard.\n\nDefinitely! Apart from sending unlimited emails, you can also create unlimited forms, unlimited automation rules, and unlimited tracking conversions.\n\nThe free trial lasts for 7 days.\n\nWe're confident BirdSend will increase and track your email marketing revenue. You're protected by our 30-day, unconditional 100% Money Back Guarantee. Here's a personal note from our CEO:\n\n_\u201cI take your business very seriously, and you have my personal guarantee that I will not rest until you grow your business with us.\u201d_\n\n~ Welly Mulia, CEO, BirdSend\n\nGive us a fair, risk-free try. If you don't see an increase in revenue or if you don't like it for ANY reason, let us know within 30 days (by clicking the bottom right icon on any of our pages) and we'll promptly refund you within the next 24 business hours. Just to be clear, there are absolutely no strings attached and no hoops to jump through. We make it completely hassle-free!\n\nUnfortunately no. We don't allow you to sell email ads nor ad swap as these typically result in many spam complaints.\n\nUnfortunately no.\n\nIf you do a mixture of educational and promotional emails (and therefore caring for your contacts' well-being), then yes you can use us.\n\nIt depends.\n\nIf all you do is send promotional emails without providing any educational value to your contacts, we do not allow that.\n\nIf you do a mixture of educational and promotional emails (and therefore caring for your contacts' well-being), then yes we do allow affiliate marketing.\n\nA contact is a person with a unique email address. Many email marketing platforms charge you by the number of subscribers, not contacts. There is a huge difference. E.g. John is on 10 different lists. In BirdSend, you only get charged for 1 contact, while others charge you for 10 subscribers.\n\nBecause with BirdSend:\n\nEmails are automatically sent to your contacts, whether you're sleeping or on vacation. Can you imagine manually sending multiple emails 1-by-1 to thousands of subscribers? That would take you ages and your fingers will get crooked!\n\nYou'll also know how much income you get from every email\u2026 hence you'll also precisely know the Lifetime Value (LTV) and Average Lifetime Value (ALTV) of your contacts. Knowing your ALTV arms you with the clarity and confidence to go \u201call out\u201d in your paid advertising campaigns. You only need to make sure you're spending less than your ALTV to acquire a new subscriber. Without knowing your ALTV, you're flying blind.\n\nBottom line:\n\n**First, you'll gain back precious time**. If we can save just 20 hours a month (you save more hours as your subscriber base grows), how much would that be worth to you? 20 precious hours that you can invest with your family, and work on other more important business tasks.\n\n**Second, you'll continue to make sales even when you're sleeping or on vacation**, because of the automation that's being taken care of by BirdSend.\n\n**Third, you'll always have your Lifetime Value and Average Lifetime Value numbers at your fingertips**. Knowing that you're generating a positive ROI allows you to sleep soundly (and happily) at night.\n\nYes, and we'll even do it for free! We'll move everything (contacts, sequences, emails, automations, forms, etc) over from your current email provider to BirdSend, so that it's hassle-free for you. After signing up, contact us and we'll go from there.\n\nDiscover how you can save 3 - 5X every month in email marketing tool expenses.",
