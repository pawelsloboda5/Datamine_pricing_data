fee.\n\n**Amazon SQS Free Tier\\***  \nYou can get started with Amazon SQS for free. All customers can make 1 million Amazon SQS requests for free each month. Some applications might be able to operate within this Free Tier limit.\n\n[View AWS Free Tier details](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)\n\n![Image 30: photo of man looking at computer](https://d1.awsstatic.com/wickr-qintel-stacked-final.b7aac4759f597d2419649008098a82f3f6a72bfa.jpeg)\n\nHow are Amazon SQS requests priced?\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe pricing for monthly requests is shown below:\n\n* * *\n\nRegion:\n\nHow are Amazon SQS charges metered?\n-----------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n**API Actions**\n\nEvery Amazon SQS action counts as a request.\n\n**FIFO Requests**\n\nAPI actions for sending, receiving, deleting, and changing visibility of messages from FIFO queues are charged at FIFO rates. \u00a0All other API requests are charged at standard rates.\n\n**Contents of Requests**\n\nA single request can have from 1 to 10 messages, up to a maximum total payload of 256 KB.  \n\n**Size of Payloads**  \n\nEach 64 KB chunk of a payload is billed as 1 request (for example, an API action with a 256 KB payload is billed as 4 requests).  \n\n**Interaction with Amazon S3**\n\nWhen using the\u00a0[Amazon SQS Extended Client Library](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sqs-java-extended-client-lib)\u00a0to send payloads using Amazon S3, you incur\u00a0[Amazon S3 charges](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)\u00a0for any Amazon S3 storage you use to send message payloads.  \n\n**Interaction with AWS KMS  \n**\n\nWhen using the\u00a0[AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)\u00a0to manage keys for SQS server-side encryption, you incur charges for calls from Amazon SQS to AWS KMS. For more information see\u00a0[KMS pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/)\u00a0and\u00a0[How Do I Estimate My AWS KMS Usage Costs?](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-estimate-kms-usage-costs)\u00a0in the\u00a0_Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.\u00a0\n\nAmazon SQS requests are listed on the [product features](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/features/) page.\n\nHow is the Amazon SQS data transfer\\*\\* priced?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe pricing below is based on data transferred in and out of Amazon SQS.\n\n* * *\n\nRegion:\n\nFor Data Transfer exceeding 500TB/Month please [Contact Us](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/aws-sales/).\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, our prices are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT and applicable sales tax. For customers with a Japanese billing address, use of AWS is subject to Japanese Consumption Tax. [Learn more](https://aws.amazon.com/c-tax-faqs/).\n\nData transfer in and out refers to transfer into and out of Amazon SQS.\n\nData transferred between Amazon SQS and Amazon EC2 or Amazon SQS and AWS Lambda within a single region is free of charge (that is, $0.00 per GB). Data transferred between Amazon SQS and Amazon EC2 or Amazon SQS and AWS Lambda in different regions is charged at Internet Data Transfer rates on both sides of the transfer.\n\n\\* Your usage of the free tier is calculated each month across all regions (except the GovCloud region) and is applied to your bill automatically. Unused free usage does not roll over to the next month. Restrictions apply. See offer terms for more details.\n\n\\*\\* As part of the [AWS Free Tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/), new AWS customers receive free 15 GB of data transfer out each month, aggregated across all AWS services for one year (this does not apply to the AWS GovCloud region).\n\n\\*\\*\\* Rate tiers for data transfers out aggregate outbound data transfer across Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, Amazon EBS, Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier, Amazon RDS, Amazon SimpleDB, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Storage Gateway, and Amazon VPC.\n\nAdditional pricing
