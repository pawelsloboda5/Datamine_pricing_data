represent interactions between a user and your product. Think about events that you want to measure and understand. Is it a purchase? Video views? Friend requests? The first step is to send that data to Mixpanel. Our flexible data model lets you bring in events easily by connecting Mixpanel to your CDP, data warehouse, or in-house data pipelines. You can also install a Mixpanel SDK.\n\nEvents-based pricing calculates the cost based on the number of events across all projects in each period. For eligible plans, you can choose to purchase monthly or annually.\n\nHow does pricing work?\n\nEvents-based pricing calculates your bill based on the number of tracked events. This model allows you to start small to keep your initial costs down and scale your analytics confidently as you grow. There are no overages if you exceed your plan, you simply pay for additional events on the same cost per event basis. It is also predictable for marketing teams running re-engagement campaigns or sending push notifications.\n\nYou can purchase our Growth plan online. If you need more help customizing an option that works for you, reach out to our sales team.\n\nHow can I estimate my event volume?\n\nIt depends on your number of active users and the number of events (interactions) a typical active user performs in your product every month (or year). These interactions include client-side engagement events (e.g., search, purchase, video view), server-side events (e.g., sign up, account upgrade), and messaging events (e.g., email sent, email opened, etc.). We encourage new customers to get started on the free plan and then upgrade once they have an estimate of their volume.\n\nWhat if I go over my prepaid amount?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve finished using your prepaid amount of events, you\u2019ll be charged our regular monthly rate for each additional event tracked that month.\n\nVolume discounts are baked in. You can save money by giving your company room to grow!\n\nWe\u2019re a startup. Do you have any discounts?\n\nWe have the best Free plan in the market (1M events) and extensive additional benefits for eligible startups, including your first year free on the Startup Plan and exclusive access to our startup community.
