Reach us through **call, chat, email, or even SMS** based on your convenience.\n\n### Local Presence - Only $300/month\n\nEffortlessly enhance your connection rates with our Local Presence. This feature automatically dials prospects using area codes local to your leads, increasing pick up rates by 47%. Your Local Presence phone numbers are dedicated to your account and not shared with others.\n\n### AI voice analytics\\*\n\nAll new xPro plans come with 5,000 minutes of our AI voice analytics tool. Our powerful AI transcribes calls, detects sentiment, highlights keywords in all conversations, and does grouping and reporting with ease. Track all sales calls, coach your team, and keep all records in your CRM.\n\n\\* after 5,000 free minutes, each transcription minute costs $0.03 (3 cents/min).\n\n### Do you have a bot?\n\nWe offer a sophisticated conversational chatbot solution, AloAi Bot, designed for dynamic and interactive dialogues. While we do not provide a web-based chatbot interface at present, it\u2019s important to note that AloAi Bot is built upon tailored workflows, ensuring it can be customized to align seamlessly with your business objectives and specific user interactions.\n\n### Compliance Assistant\n\n10DLC registration and campaign verification is embedded into our app with easy to use forms and a virtual assistant. For enterprise accounts, we have a dedicated, in-house team of experts focused on calling and texting compliance, including A2P 10dlc, SHAKEN/STIR, voice integrity and CNAM verification.\n\n\\* Managed A2P 10dlc registration is available for a $500 one-time fee.\n\n### Unlimited calls to US & Canada - all plans\n\nAll agent-to-consumer and consumer-to-agent calls are free on Aloware (excluding toll-free). When you buy a local number from us, your agents can make unlimited calls and send one-to-one texts with no pay-per-minute charges. **All automated usage**, such as SMS API, Sequences, Broadcasts SMS, Calls & SMS initiated from CRM Workflows (HubSpot, Zapier, Pipedrive, Zoho) and toll-free minutes and SMS are **charged according to the rates below**.\n\n### Is it really unlimited?\n\nYes \u2013 unlike most of our competitors, our agent-to-consumer minutes are really free. Some of our competitors advertise\u00a0_free_\u00a0with an asterisk, which means inbound is free and outbound is not. With Aloware, it\u2019s truly free. As we said above, **all automated usage** and bulk messages **are charged separately** according to the rates set below.\n\n### How about outbound campaigns?\n\nYou are welcome to set up your outbound campaigns including text broadcasts and automated drip sequences with Aloware. You can also trigger calls and texts upon form submission or through CRM workflows.\n\nBilling for such automated actions will be based on the actual call minutes and text messages sent. For additional rates on outbound call and text sequences, please see the ala carte- pricing table above.\n\n### Can I bring my existing numbers?\n\nYes you can. All you need to do is fill out a form and submit it to us for processing. Your numbers will be ready in 7 to 10 business days.\n\n[Download Form](https://aloware.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LOA-Blank.pdf)\n\n### Does this work with big teams?\n\nIt works with any team, big or small. We support teams from as small as 5 members, to big teams with 200 members in different departments. Larger teams can swear by the convenience of our Task Routing and Call Distribution tools.\n\n### Can I see it in action?\n\nYes! We\u2019re open for a limited self-serve trial, or you can book a demo with one of our sales consultants. For larger teams, it\u2019s best that you get a personal and tailored demo of what Aloware offers. For smaller teams, just sign up, choose a plan, and start calling.\n\n### Do I need special hardware for this?\n\nNo need for that. Aloware\u2019s system runs in the cloud which makes it easier for you to install and use it from any device. Our softphone feature can be opened in the browser, on your desktop or within your CRM. For those on-the-go, our mobile app is completely operational with Aloware\u2019s best features.\n\n### What kind of support is available?\n\nWe provide 24/7 support to all clients regardless of size, over online chat. If you have urgent questions or require urgent assistance, we also offer phone support from 7am EST to 7pm PST, including weekends and holidays.\n\nFor enterprise accounts, we offer support via Slack as well as dedicated account managers.\n\n### Carrier fees\n\nAny SMS/MMS sent through Aloware (whether agent-based or automated) is subject to carrier fees imposed by major US carriers, ranging from $0.005 to $0.015 per segment.

Reach us through **call, chat, email, or even SMS** based on your convenience.\n\n### Local Presence - Only $300/month\n\nEffortlessly enhance your connection rates with our Local Presence. This feature automatically dials prospects using area codes local to your leads, increasing pick up rates by 47%. Your Local Presence phone numbers are dedicated to your account and not shared with others.\n\n### AI voice analytics\\*\n\nAll new xPro plans come with 5,000 minutes of our AI voice analytics tool. Our powerful AI transcribes calls, detects sentiment, highlights keywords in all conversations, and does grouping and reporting with ease. Track all sales calls, coach your team, and keep all records in your CRM.\n\n\\* after 5,000 free minutes, each transcription minute costs $0.03 (3 cents/min).\n\n### Do you have a bot?\n\nWe offer a sophisticated conversational chatbot solution, AloAi Bot, designed for dynamic and interactive dialogues. While we do not provide a web-based chatbot interface at present, it\u2019s important to note that AloAi Bot is built upon tailored workflows, ensuring it can be customized to align seamlessly with your business objectives and specific user interactions.\n\n### Compliance Assistant\n\n10DLC registration and campaign verification is embedded into our app with easy to use forms and a virtual assistant. For enterprise accounts, we have a dedicated, in-house team of experts focused on calling and texting compliance, including A2P 10dlc, SHAKEN/STIR, voice integrity and CNAM verification.\n\n\\* Managed A2P 10dlc registration is available for a $500 one-time fee.\n\n### Unlimited calls to US & Canada - all plans\n\nAll agent-to-consumer and consumer-to-agent calls are free on Aloware (excluding toll-free). When you buy a local number from us, your agents can make unlimited calls and send one-to-one texts with no pay-per-minute charges. **All automated usage**, such as SMS API, Sequences, Broadcasts SMS, Calls & SMS initiated from CRM Workflows (HubSpot, Zapier, Pipedrive, Zoho) and toll-free minutes and SMS are **charged according to the rates below**.\n\n### Is it really unlimited?\n\nYes \u2013 unlike most of our competitors, our agent-to-consumer minutes are really free. Some of our competitors advertise\u00a0_free_\u00a0with an asterisk, which means inbound is free and outbound is not. With Aloware, it\u2019s truly free. As we said above, **all automated usage** and bulk messages **are charged separately** according to the rates set below.\n\n### How about outbound campaigns?\n\nYou are welcome to set up your outbound campaigns including text broadcasts and automated drip sequences with Aloware. You can also trigger calls and texts upon form submission or through CRM workflows.\n\nBilling for such automated actions will be based on the actual call minutes and text messages sent. For additional rates on outbound call and text sequences, please see the ala carte- pricing table above.\n\n### Can I bring my existing numbers?\n\nYes you can. All you need to do is fill out a form and submit it to us for processing. Your numbers will be ready in 7 to 10 business days.\n\n[Download Form](https://aloware.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LOA-Blank.pdf)\n\n### Does this work with big teams?\n\nIt works with any team, big or small. We support teams from as small as 5 members, to big teams with 200 members in different departments. Larger teams can swear by the convenience of our Task Routing and Call Distribution tools.\n\n### Can I see it in action?\n\nYes! We\u2019re open for a limited self-serve trial, or you can book a demo with one of our sales consultants. For larger teams, it\u2019s best that you get a personal and tailored demo of what Aloware offers. For smaller teams, just sign up, choose a plan, and start calling.\n\n### Do I need special hardware for this?\n\nNo need for that. Aloware\u2019s system runs in the cloud which makes it easier for you to install and use it from any device. Our softphone feature can be opened in the browser, on your desktop or within your CRM. For those on-the-go, our mobile app is completely operational with Aloware\u2019s best features.\n\n### What kind of support is available?\n\nWe provide 24/7 support to all clients regardless of size, over online chat. If you have urgent questions or require urgent assistance, we also offer phone support from 7am EST to 7pm PST, including weekends and holidays.\n\nFor enterprise accounts, we offer support via Slack as well as dedicated account managers.\n\n### Carrier fees\n\nAny SMS/MMS sent through Aloware (whether agent-based or automated) is subject to carrier fees imposed by major US carriers, ranging from $0.005 to $0.015 per segment.
