In that time I\u2019ve sent out a weekly eblast every single week without fail. iContact is my primary source of marketing for my retail seafood and wine market, and I would be lost without it. While there are other formats available, and at times I\u2019ve certainly considered switching over, I don\u2019t regret sticking with iContact.\n\nCustomer support is one of their greatest strengths, and down through the years I\u2019ve certainly taken advantage of their expertise and have never been turned away from a phone call or had an email inquiry not returned in a reasonable amount of time.\u201d\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\nCan I change my plan later?\n\nYes, we allow you to upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.\n\nWhat are the main differences between the plans?\n\nOur Premium plan offers access to all of our features, with limited restrictions. Our Standard plan will restrict access to some features as well as add limits to the amount of lists, segments, automations and landing pages you have.\n\nIs there a limit to the number of emails I can send?\n\nYes, each of our plans has sending limits based off the amount of contacts included in your plan. If you go over your monthly sending limits, you will be charged overages for the send.\n\nHow does billing work?\n\nOur billing is monthly on the first of every month for monthly plans. For annual plans, we bill on the first of the month annually. When you sign up you will be billed a prorated monthly amount.\n\niContact, Easy Solution For All Your Email Marketing Needs\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Pre-Designed Email Templates\n*   Easy Drag and Drop Email Builder\n*   Hundreds of Premium Stock Photos\n\nGet detailed pricing information on iContact services for all types of businesses.

In that time I\u2019ve sent out a weekly eblast every single week without fail. iContact is my primary source of marketing for my retail seafood and wine market, and I would be lost without it. While there are other formats available, and at times I\u2019ve certainly considered switching over, I don\u2019t regret sticking with iContact.\n\nCustomer support is one of their greatest strengths, and down through the years I\u2019ve certainly taken advantage of their expertise and have never been turned away from a phone call or had an email inquiry not returned in a reasonable amount of time.\u201d\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\nCan I change my plan later?\n\nYes, we allow you to upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.\n\nWhat are the main differences between the plans?\n\nOur Premium plan offers access to all of our features, with limited restrictions. Our Standard plan will restrict access to some features as well as add limits to the amount of lists, segments, automations and landing pages you have.\n\nIs there a limit to the number of emails I can send?\n\nYes, each of our plans has sending limits based off the amount of contacts included in your plan. If you go over your monthly sending limits, you will be charged overages for the send.\n\nHow does billing work?\n\nOur billing is monthly on the first of every month for monthly plans. For annual plans, we bill on the first of the month annually. When you sign up you will be billed a prorated monthly amount.\n\niContact, Easy Solution For All Your Email Marketing Needs\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Pre-Designed Email Templates\n*   Easy Drag and Drop Email Builder\n*   Hundreds of Premium Stock Photos\n\nGet detailed pricing information on iContact services for all types of businesses.
