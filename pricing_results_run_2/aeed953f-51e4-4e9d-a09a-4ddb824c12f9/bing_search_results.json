This is our way of keeping your costs low while giving you access to attorney-level quality and peace of mind.\n    \n*   ##### How does the Extra Usage feature work?\n    \n    iubenda provides **Extra Usage** for its paid plans. This is applied to the Privacy Controls and Cookie Solution (for page views).\n    \n    If you reach the limit of use for your plan, the **Extra Usage** allows the product to continue working with an extra charge, please see the [pricing page](https://www.iubenda.com/en/pricing) for more details.\n    \n*   ##### What payment options are there?\n    \n    You can pay by credit card or PayPal.\n    \n*   ##### What about refunds?\n    \n    Request your refund by 14 days after your purchase or renewal, no questions asked!\n    \n*   ##### Is Google Consent Mode support included in all plans?\n    \n    Yes, it's included in all plans, even the Free one. Essential for websites running Google Ads or Google Analytics and targeting European users, it prevents marketing data loss from rejected consent banners. Note: Starting March 2024, Google has incrementally mandated the use of Consent Mode for accessing audience personalization and measurement features in its services when targeting European users.
